hrhvdx,"hello all, 

starting nearly two weeks ago i began to develop a very mild sore throat. ignored it thinking it was just my allergies, i often have sore throats due to my allergies so it was not a point of concern for me, but as the sore throat persisted i began to worry and eventually went to get tested for covid on thursday of last week.  the test was a rapid test and my results came back negative in less than an hour. i figured it was still just allergies at that point. come sunday morning, my sore throat is worse and not only that but i developed a fever and body chills and aches overnight. because i already tested negative before i figured i might have had strep and took myself to my doctors, there they offer to test me for covid again and the next day, on monday,  i received my results which were positive. since receiving my results, i have not had a fever or body aches, i've only popped a few painkillers on monday and none on tuesday.  i am still a little fatigued but i believe it is mainly due to my lack of sleep from worrying so much. 

&#x200b;

tonight (tuesday night) i lost my ability to smell and taste. this just threw me into an anxiety attack as i contemplated the possibility of this being permanent or me never getting my full sense of smell and taste back. right now i am very anxious and worried, i am not sure where this illness is going or if i am near the end at all. the anxiety sucks because it causes me to have shortness of breath which is a symptom, thus causing me to get more anxiety. honestly,  than the loss of smell and taste, i have no  symptoms right now, but the anxiety is making my experience a living hell. 

has anyone else dealt with extreme anxiety while dealing with covid? any advice?

also, is it safe to assume i am out of the worst of it? i started showing symptoms nearly two weeks ago and then a few days ago was when suddenly i woke up with the fever and aches which are gone now. should i be worried about more to come?

any advice or comments are appreciated.

i0a3fm,"so i tested positive today. i work in a hospital and had been told the usual doctrine for months of isolate + get tested if you have fever / persistant new cough / loss of smell or taste. 

i started feeling ill on saturday. sore throat, congestion, muscle aches, feeling hot / cold (no definite fever), headache type stuff.  none of the 3 symptoms above. just standard cold symptoms. i'd also just started fasting and was mid 70hr fast when symptoms appeared. thought it may be related and didn't think too much of it. 

a few months ago i isolated briefly and got tested for what turned out to be a cold so i didn't want to risk pissing off my bosses by calling in again, this time for ""non-covid symptoms"". it just isn't done, and we are so short staffed i thought i might get laughed at. 

i also have anxiety (don't we all) and often confuse my hypochondria with actual real symptoms. if i called in to work every time i felt ""off"" then i would never be in work at all. i tend to power through regardless. 

we get tested weekly at work and i arranged that test asap knowing that on the off chance it was covid it would be picked up.

so now my symptoms are worse (and more covid specific), but harder to deal with is the fact i may have passed it on at work. to vulnerable patients. 

how do i move past this crippling guilt that someone may get really sick because of me.

i am experiencing bad insomnia. my mind isnt shutting off, i cannot sleep my body needs to be dead tired to even sleep for 1-2 hours a day. i suffer from sleep apnea as well. i keep overthinking and i cant sleep at all. i think ive only gotten about 7-8 hours of sleep this past week

g025b1,"i posted this in the daily discussion thread but figured it might get more visibility as its own thread. 

im a 28/m, no preexisting health conditions, normal bmi. confirmed positive and currently on day 6. my symptoms have been mild so far. started tuesday 4/7 with what i thought were allergies (runny nose, slight sinus headache, itchy/watery eyes, very occasional dry cough). thinking it was allergies i took claritin d which had no effect.  

later that night i had an elevated temperature of 99.65. developed chills which bed me all night. the following morning my temp was 100.19 and the earlier described symptoms continued with the addition of a dull pain on my eyes when i moved them up/down/left/right - never felt a sensation like that before. i called my local hospital and they had me tested later that day (4/8). symptoms continued through the following day (4/9) which is when i received the call confirming i was positive.  highest my temp ever got was 100.40 and i havent experienced any shortness of breath or uncomfortable chest sensations. 

since 4/10 i've been feeling pretty good. my temp has been normal (high 96s to low 98s), my headache is gone, and my eyes arent bing me anymore, and my blood o2 is 97-99%. i still have an occasional runny nose and a very infrequent cough.  regardless i am still in isolation - but if i didnt pay as close of attention to my symptoms and didnt get tested i would probably be outside running today.  i live with my fiance and she has been totally fine and symptom free throughout. 

does this sound familar to anyone? and now the impossible question... if this does sound familar, any idea on if i should get better or worse from here? i know im not out of the storm yet but i keep seeing stories on this sub of people who had mild symptoms that then got significantly worse. i dont know if im freaking myself out unnecessarily.",$$$C0085593$$$C0151827$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C1260880$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1260880$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C1260880$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0151827$$$C0085593$$$C0013456$$$C1260880$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0948596$$$C0151827$$$C0010200$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

gin6vk,"i made a post last week asking if any  recovered people were having neurological issues after recovering. i'm on my phone and i'm not messing with trying to post the link with it. long story not so short: i'm having issues when speaking, i forget a word and when i try and recall it, my mind blanks and i freeze. i've also had bouts of 'returning'  covid symptoms. i'll get a cough and have difficulty breathing for a couple days. 

i went to my pcp today to get checked out. i had a curve ball thrown at me last week though. wednesday of last week, i found a tick attached to my back. i didn't think much of it after i pulled it off and went about my life. the bite has since developed a red circle around it and i woke up sunday with horrible muscle soreness in my upper back muscles with neck stiffness. i had a temp of 99.9 and my wbc was elevated. so, labs to test for lyme and colorado tick fever were ordered.

but wait! there's more! i told my dr about the returning symptoms and how i've started to notice i have pressure in my chest. my blood pressure was 117/85 and my oxygen saturation was at 98 but when she listened to my lungs, she could hear my struggle for deep breathing so she put the finger thing back on and my pulse stayed steady between 102/103. she ordered chest x-rays for tomorrow to see if i have some lung damage from the virus. 

i also have an appointment with a neurologist tomorrow to see if i need imaging for the speech issues. 

the elevated pulse and breathing has me a bit concerned. i've seen my dr twice since recovering and these weren't issues that i've had until recently. i don't understand how it would suddenly pop up 6 weeks after recovering.",$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0231528$$$C0015967$$$C0231528$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0741585$$$C0010200$$$C0012833$$$C0741585$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0741585$$$C0008031$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

hsqxyq,"background: 22 year old male, no underlying health conditions, mostly healthy diet, fit/active.  

i took two coronavirus test 5 days ago. i'm not sure exactly what each of them mean but the results are: 

covid-19 qpcr : positive

covid-19 igg : pending 

  
i am very worried because i am expecting a wave of brutal symptoms to hit me soon. i got the test 5 days ago because i started noticing symptoms about two weeks ago. they were very mild. my seasonal flu last year was much worse. my timeline of symptoms went something like this.. 

7/3-7 : mild cough, congestion, headache, chills,  (no fever) 

7/8-10 : cough getting better, congestion, headache, total loss of taste/smell , (no fever)

7/11 : got tested 

7/11-12: only symptoms were headache, congestion, and lack of taste/smell (starting to come back)

7/13 - today: no symptoms, feeling totally fine. 

where do i go from here? i've called everyone i've been in contact with and i'm planning on isolating 2 weeks from the time i felt better. should i expect to feel better and suddenly succumb to severe symptoms? or can i just feel confident that i had a mild case?",$$$C0018681$$$C0010200$$$C0003126$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C0018681$$$C2364111$$$C2364111$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C0010200$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
