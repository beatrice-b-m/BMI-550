fk7h61,2020-03-17 11:47:00 UTC,my housemate tested positive for the virus and i have had a serious headache and stuffy nose for the past 3 days aswell as some chest tightness. i have been in contact with my doctor and am going to be tested. i am asthmatic so pretty anxious about the whole thing. i'm also back home at my parents place which is an apartment. i feel like being quarantined here could put them at risk. any tips for smaller space quarantine and reassuring words?,$$$anxious$$$nose$$$headache$$$stuffy nose$$$tightness$$$whole$$$,"$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Headache$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Chest tightness$$$Body ache & Pain$$$",$$$C1832070$$$C1260880$$$C0018681$$$C1260880$$$C0235710$$$C0741585$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
flhocd,2020-03-19 16:57:00 UTC,"so, i started feeling off monday at noon. by monday evening i had a fever of 101, and a horrid scratchy cough. tuesday morning i woke up with my body sore and my chest hurting, and could not stop coughing. by wednesday iâ€™d lost my voice and continued to cough and hurt all over. i learned that i had been exposed to someone with covid at my community college. it hurts to breathe, i feel like i cannot take a full breath, and i just want this to stop.

update 03/20/20
still feel horrid, but actually got up and walked around. that was a mistake, as i started gasping for air after walking up the stairs to the kitchen (i carried clorox wipes with me and wipe whatever i touch.) decided i needed some fresh air so i left my house, and the neighborhood was deserted, so i went for a short walk. made it to the first cul-de-sac and turned around as i was getting winded. the sun and the air did help my spirits, and fresh air tasted good. 

from what iâ€™ve read from others experiences, the 4th and 5th days are the worst. if this is the worst this virus is gonna give me, then iâ€™m gonna be fine.  i am grateful for everyoneâ€™s well wishes. iâ€™m glad i could answer some questions. feel free to ask away; iâ€™m not going anywhere.

update 03/21/20
my fever broke! yesterday, my cough was so bad and breathing was so difficult that i called into express care telehealth. the pa prescribed albuterol and benzonatate (aerosol steroid and muuuuch stronger cough suppressant) to control the symptoms. itâ€™s worked wonders, and it has been great to not feel like iâ€™m having cramps or iâ€™m gonna throw up with all of the coughing. my lungs hurt; feels like i had razor blades in there. my body is still super sore. but i feel like iâ€™m no longer in active fighting of the virus, and now my body is in recovery. 

i can now say with certainty that i have/had a mild case. i have read others stories of covid lasting much longer. maybe iâ€™m recovering because i have a stronger immune system. maybe itâ€™s because i isolated almost immediately and rested, using the best tools at my disposal to control symptoms.

03/23/20
nope. nope nope nope. feverâ€™s back. cough is back. cough is worse now. body hurts.chest hurts. iâ€™m really winded too. f*** this.

03/25/20
so at some point on monday the fever broke. i still have coughing fits, but they are more â€œwetâ€ and higher up in my throat. the length of time between major coughing fits seems to be getting longer and longer. itâ€™s striking me today just how beat up my body feels. how beat up my lungs feel. 

i did go for a walk in the woods today to get some fresh air. i kind of regret it because i totally over exerted myself, and also tripped over a fallen log. but iâ€™m now strong enough to even do that.

flhqni,2020-03-19 17:00:00 UTC,"my girlfriend and i both tested positive, quick backstory (she was the carrier as she works in pharmacy, had a cough for one day and a mild fever so was sent home, scheduled a tele-doc appointment who said there was a 70% chance she had it so we should both go get tested) - the next day, we got tested at a local practice that offered it. the doctor came in and said we both came back positive. she sat down, went over what to do, how to monitor the symptoms and manage.) 

no medicine. just a note ordering to self quarantine in home. so here we are. day 2 officially of 14, but they recommended to go to 20 just to be safe. 

what i felt: 

â€¢tingling in chest

â€¢mild cough

â€¢on &amp;amp; off fever

â€¢exhaustion

â€¢small muscle aches
 

my girlfriends symptoms were about double the severity, but still nothing worth hospitalization or medication.

and... thatâ€™s it. we are both feeling much better from just staying hydrated and eating a lot. 

our only concern is preventing spreading of it!

overall maybe 6-7 days worth of mild symptoms with the worse being on the 4th-5th day. 

sheâ€™s getting paid for two weeks + benefits and i work from home so itâ€™s no stress. thankfully, we have all we need right now and for up to 30 days.

our stats: 

â€¢not overweight.

â€¢no underlying conditions. 

â€¢in our 20â€™s. 
 
so the general idea, is that if you are like us, and catch it. you will 100% be okay, just be cautious not to give it to others. thatâ€™s the mission.

edit: weird dreams. 100%. every single night. very lucid, very strange. both good and bad. just remembered we both have been talking about our dreams.

edit 2: to those asking about the test and the process, i will not deny it is 100% a position of privilege as to how we got our test. the initial test was the â€œeliminate optionâ€ test, where they test for all, and if you come back negative thereâ€™s an 85-95% chance you have it, and then we were issued the full test following that. we are not considered high risk. you may message me to ask about this, but iâ€™m sorry i wonâ€™t tell anyone what state i live in directly, but population is totally â€œaverage.â€ both were swab tests up the nose. not fun, but didnâ€™t hurt at all.

edit 3: symptom tracker overall. figured this is useful.

started off with:

-really bad aches & pains (still happening) â€” like brittle joints and spasms and just tension and pain everywhere 

-sore throat (stopped around day 4) 

-general fatigue (still happening)

-very frequent, mild diarrhea (still happening) 

.

day three or four: 

-drainage and thick mucus. bad congestion. almost like drowning level.

-fatigue worsens 

-sore throat gone 

.

day five:

-cough 

-little sleep

.

day six: 

-bad cough 

-almost no sleep

.

today, day 7 (now, medicated)

-drainage. not much mucus. 

-mild cough 

-aches & pains are still horrible 

-frequent mild diarrhea 

-runny nose (new!!!!) â€” itâ€™s like... pouring. flowing water.

iâ€™ve lost 15 pounds in a weekâ€™s time. iâ€™m constantly hydrating. eating regularly. i have been on medication for about 24 hours now. highly medicated. itâ€™s its own kind of discomfort. but iâ€™m sleeping again!

flj8sg,2020-03-19 18:28:00 UTC,"i was teaching a course for a federal agency and one of my students was exposed by someone who attended the church in georgetown. he came in to class last tuesday, feeling ill, then got a call that his acquaintance was positive. 

we immediately cancelled the course and sent everyone to quarantine. the student was tested and subsequently came back positive. 

i had to quarantine away from family because my daughter is a preemie and i couldnâ€™t risk further exposing her. about 48 hours later i developed symptoms and subsequently tested positive. 

managing my symptoms have been a royal mess. my pcp said she â€œwanted nothing to do with thisâ€. the ers have no idea what to do when my symptoms worsened and told me â€œwhat do you want me to do, there is no cure for thisâ€. so itâ€™s been a mess. when i finally got my positive result suddenly my pcp wanted to treat me. honestly the thing thatâ€™s worked best for me is whiskey believe it or not, and i hate the stuff. 

the medical community has been chaos. no one knows what to do. the county health department though has been handling my case very well and i have been very pleased with their support. 

worst cough iâ€™ve ever had and the deepest lung pain. itâ€™s hard to describe - itâ€™s not chest pain in the traditional sense itâ€™s like a deep lung pain and itâ€™s awful. headache. rundown. severe fatigue. mild to no fever however. 

i have been starting to feel much better and am just counting down the days to kick this and get back to my wife and baby girl. 

good luck everyone and stay safe!

update: somehow the place i was staying found out and required me to vacate or be forcibly removed. my wife and baby girl had to relocate so that i can quarantine at home. the health department was pissed, but their only recourse would be to take over the hotel and they couldnâ€™t do that at this point. 

the worst is that the lung pain has intensified severely likely due to me frantically packing up my room and trying to get out of there. but based on previous experience iâ€™m afraid to go to the er. 

this whole thing has been a nightmare.

update 2: iâ€™m back in the er with shortness of breath and chest pain.

flt9a2,2020-03-20 07:10:00 UTC,"hey friends - this is a positive post and reassurance... not to be taken alarmingly at all.
.
.
yes i have tested positive to #covid19  and am currently under the wonderful care and concern of the lovely nursing team and doctors of redlands hospital ...
.
.
initial symptoms were body aches, a dry cough, chills and sweats, diarrhoea, shortness of breath and an increased usage of my childhood asthma puffer.
other symptoms presented were headaches and a sore throat...
.
.
what did stand out was the body aches increasing to start to feel more like aching bones, more frequent coughing and a tight chest and sometimes a sore throat.
.
.
what i can tell you, is that i am not dying, i am still relatively healthy and just going through a virus. .
.
this is no disrespect to anyone who is suffering more than me right now, but, in comparison to what the media is presenting, i am feeling fairly fine- yes i use my puffer, yes i'm on panadine forte/ sometimes stronger for the pain- and i probably couldn't sit at a desk all day as i'm uncomfortable but i am still a highly functioning woman who will not let this hysteria get in her way!!!
.
.
it comes in waves, the symptoms i mean, and so does my anxiety around it all, but i've learned to limit my news consumption, increase my positive conversations (even if it is only with the nursing staff in their quarantine get up ðÿ˜‚) and using this time not to dwell but it re energise and reform. .
.
.
sure so much uncertainty, and if i think about it enough, it starts to stress me out, but that's when my positive mental attitude (pma) takes ahold.
.
.
this is a time to establish solid friendships and connections, take the time to reach out to a love one, create a positive culture and caring community around you- even in isolation we're not closed off entirely thanks to technology.
.
.
spread joy- not fear- grow your capacity, think less and do more, grow through not go through, tell someone you love them, consume less, give more, determine your why, meditate, energise and impact, flick the switch on your mindsets, hate less, shift your anger, uplift and  above all else open your heart and your eyes- we will get through this ðÿ’ªðÿ’ª ðÿ’ªðÿ’“

fmh6yb,2020-03-21 12:02:00 UTC,"since there is very little information out there, i decided to post my symptom progression to anyone interested.

female, age 38, 5'6 118lbs. ms and asthma. taking advair and albuterol. living in nys.

i started jotting down how i felt once i realized something was off. here is my symptom journal...

day 1 3/14/20

headache, sore throat. the sore throat feeling also is in the back of my nose, maybe in my sinus? could be allergies? no fever. 

day 2 3/15/20

sore throat is worse, kinda feel like something is in my sinuses... they kinda feel blocked. uncomfortable feeling in the back of my head, base of my skull. no fever. 

day 3 3/16/20

throat still scratchy but better, definitely feels like strep behind my nose though. started feeling achy and very tired. no fever. 

day 4 3/17/20

very difficult to get up for work, extremely exhausted. didn't sleep well, couldn't get comfortable. headache, aches, pain in the base of skull, continued ""strep in nose"" feeling. no fever, self isolating. 

day 5 3/18/20

all previous symptoms with the addition of a mild, nonproductive cough. no fever

day 6 3/19/20

nys health department called. had prolonged exposure to a positive case. placed on quarantine, they aren't coming to test. told to call my doctor. cough has escalated, difficulty walking up and down stairs. no fever. 

day 7 3/20/20

shortness of breath, heaviness in chest, pain in left lung when i breathe. i didn't sleep last night... kept coughing. low grade fever 99.2. doctor sending me for evaluation. 

at evaluation my blood pressure was low, heart rate was 139, oxygen levels low. they gave me a breathing treatment and was told to stay under quarantine. ""high probability"" of covid but cannot test me because my temperature wasn't above 101. eval looked like a war zone. 

------------

here we are at day 8, i haven't made an entry yet. i will say last week (maybe the 12th or so) i did have a stomach thing that started this off. i didn't connect any dots, but in case it's relevant, here you go. 

still no mentionable fever. heart rate resting at 115, spikes over 150 when i walk. chest still heavy, sore throat is gone, still strep feeling behind nose. woke up in a huge coughing fit, but after i cleared my lungs i was better. i feel out of it, little bit of confusion... things just feeling off, not sure how to describe that. 

either way, hope this helps someone.

i'll continue to update as symptoms progress or resolve as applicable.

edit: posting links to stomach connection and heart rate connection in comments.

edit: additional symptom not considered is a lack of taste and smell. considering the intense ""strep in back of nose"" feeling, maybe it has something to do with that? i had complained about not being able to taste anything to my kids, but hadn't connected any dots.

update: day 9

massive headache, pain in eye and increased pressure at base of skull. fever fluctuated over night, highest was 99.6 lowest 96.4. chest heaviness seems to have subsided. there's some rattling in my chest when i breathe, mild pain in left lung. all in all better than previous days.",$$$levels$$$fever$$$throat$$$but$$$breathe$$$sleep$$$taste$$$coughing$$$headache$$$something$$$fever$$$stomach$$$fever$$$taste$$$throat$$$but$$$self$$$fever$$$fever$$$heart rate$$$something$$$throat$$$heaviness$$$but$$$sinuses$$$achy$$$eye$$$throat$$$fever$$$cough$$$massive headache$$$stomach$$$fever$$$fever$$$but$$$nose$$$cough$$$strep$$$heaviness$$$throat$$$nose$$$fever$$$confusion$$$sleep$$$nose$$$nose$$$smell$$$low grade fever$$$headache$$$headache$$$something$$$but$$$nose$$$head$$$strep$$$grade fever$$$strep$$$breathe$$$coughing$$$tired$$$strep$$$sinus$$$breath$$$heart rate$$$temperature$$$breathing$$$heart rate$$$coughing fit$$$,$$$other$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Ageusia$$$Cough$$$Headache$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Pyrexia$$$Ageusia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Chest tightness$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Eye pain$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Headache$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Cough$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Headache$$$Headache$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Headache$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Dyspnea$$$Palpitations$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Palpitations$$$Cough$$$,$$$C0000000$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0917801$$$C2364111$$$C0010200$$$C0018681$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0015967$$$C2364111$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0235710$$$C2363731$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0948596$$$C0741585$$$C0151827$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0018681$$$C0011991$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1260880$$$C0010200$$$C2363731$$$C0235710$$$C2363731$$$C1260880$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C0917801$$$C1260880$$$C1260880$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C0018681$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C1260880$$$C0018681$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0013404$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C2363731$$$C0948596$$$C0013404$$$C0030252$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0030252$$$C0010200$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
fmjsz2,2020-03-21 14:41:00 UTC,"hello! i just did an ama (am still doing it) on the coronavirus asthma subreddit, i can share it here too if youâ€™re interested - feel free to ask me questions if you like! lots of free time! and i hope this can help some of the more anxious of you here. 

i began developing symptoms last sunday. extreme fatigue, aching joints, shortness of breath, severe headache, and more. however the nhs states that you can only have coronavirus if you have a fever and a bad cough, so despite me being fairly ill, i was actually told on the phone that it may be anxiety (lol) or that it may be the flu, bronchitis etc. however the breathing problems were and still are debilitating. it feels like thereâ€™s a pile of bricks on my chest. i was steaming for half an hour the other day and it didnâ€™t do anything. 

just got diagnosed following 2 nights of no sleep as it felt like iâ€™d stop breathing if i fell asleep. lying down is out of the question, i have to sleep with five pillows so weâ€™ll see how that works tonight! however they said iâ€™m extremely healthy especially for an asthmatic and i have a strong immune system! theyâ€™ve given me steroids and just an inhaler and iâ€™m also taking paracetamol a couple times a day just to help things. the paramedics i spoke to said that avoiding ibuprofen is a myth and that it absolutely works. also that itâ€™s most likely iâ€™m going to be immune and have a stronger immune system following this. 

overall i feel very lucky! so if you have asthma and youâ€™re worried i promise itâ€™s hard but totally manageable if you have patience and a positive attitude.",$$$sleep$$$breathing$$$anxious$$$worried$$$but$$$breathing$$$joints$$$breath$$$fatigue$$$headache$$$aching$$$anxiety$$$sleep$$$fever$$$bricks$$$cough$$$,"$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Dyspnea$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Arthralgia$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Headache$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Cough$$$",$$$C0917801$$$C0013404$$$C1832070$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0003862$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0018681$$$C0741585$$$C1832070$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C0010200$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

i (30f) was lucky enough to get tested (because of my job), which is very difficult in my country right now. got a call from the microbiologist this late afternoon that i was positive. i wanted to write down my own symptoms since noticing i had a slight fever when my husband told me he had a fever. 

i am now on day 4, symptoms started friday. 

i had a mild fever day 1, (37,7) coughing started throughout the day, was a dry cough.

day 2 i got a fever and coughed more and i got muscle ache all over my body. woke up with a hell of a headache. 

the night between 2 and 3 was rough, woke up a lot and had a lot of pain in my neck. also got the cough i get when i get bronchitis. it passed during the night.

day 3 was the worst day yet. woke up with muscle ache in my entire body and a headache. coughing pretty much gone but i was getting woozy and some shortness of breath when increasing activity (still have 2 kids running around age 3 and 21 months). also got a higher fever, 38,8. (husband had 39,3 at one point).
also got a stuffy nose. donâ€™t feel like eating. 

day 4 (today) i am feeling a bit better. temp is down to 38, body doesnâ€™t ache as much. still have the shortness of breath and dizziness when doing too much at once. still have a stuffy nose and still donâ€™t have an appetite. 


husband is now experiencing loss of smell and taste which i noticed more people were having. he also had some diarrhea last tuesday. he noticed something was off on thursday and got a fever on friday.

fnw93d,2020-03-23 21:24:00 UTC,"hey all,

i promised to give updates. iâ€™m still not feeling great. iâ€™m out of prednisone now and wondering if i should ask for more. it really helped keep my breathing clearer and stave off the coughing fits. the coughs are somewhat less prolonged. i tried to do some minor exercise... just stretching/yoga. but my head is just pounding. it feels like iâ€™m underwater. 

the hydrocodone cough syrup is a life saver right now. if you can phone in to your doctor i really, really recommend asking for it. i can sleep almost entirely through the night with a moderate dose (2 tsp ~ 10mg). under advice of a doctor here iâ€™ve upped my ventolin to 6 times a day and it does help quite a bit. fluids... iâ€™m sick of drinking water... gatorade is okay. helps to freeze it a bit and eat it like a snow cone. iâ€™m still sweating through the night and wake up feeling like the sahara desert crapped in my mouth... sorry... thatâ€™s about the best visual. dry is the theme of the past few days... my nostrils are dry and chapped, my lips, my skin even feels dry and not as elastic. i know iâ€™m a bit dehydrated but trying my best. 

my partner still doesnâ€™t have symptoms! iâ€™m so happy about that!! like over the moon! i know that doesnâ€™t mean he isnâ€™t carrying the virus and weâ€™re taking that very seriously. we ordered some food delivery boxes. thatâ€™s been great! neither of us want to deal with the chaos of asking friends and family to go to grocery stores for us. with community transmission, i absolutely donâ€™t want them going out. everyone is skyping me and keeping me company. iâ€™m begging them to stay home. forget about work... money will come... itâ€™s not worth going to grab a freaking latte in a pandemic! iâ€™m a bit mad when i see people going out anyway... i know, itâ€™s scary and denial is easy.. but i just want to shake them! iâ€™m not even the worst off with this virus. iâ€™d say all in all iâ€™ve been very very lucky that iâ€™m still breathing on my own and functioning. lots of people are suffering way worse than i am.. but i still feel like garbage. i wish people would just listen! sorry to rant... 

iâ€™m doing okay! thatâ€™s the main take away.",$$$but$$$but$$$sweating$$$but$$$but$$$moderate$$$breathing$$$cough$$$skin$$$coughing fits$$$dehydrated$$$coughs$$$breathing$$$coughing$$$away$$$eat$$$head$$$sleep$$$,$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Dyspnea$$$Cough$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Cough$$$Dehydration$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Loss of appetite$$$Headache$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$,$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0020458$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1260880$$$C0013404$$$C0010200$$$C0741585$$$C0010200$$$C0011175$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C0232462$$$C0018681$$$C0917801$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
fog8re,2020-03-24 20:01:00 UTC,"hey everyone i created a throwaway to tell you about my journey so far.

i will give you a backround of myself aswell

27 male- in excellent shape (gym 5-6 days a week for last 3 years), o+ blood type, no prior health problems, i get a cold once a year (if that). minor allergies (pollen, pine), 6'2, 210 lbs.  only suppliments i take daily are creatine, preworkout (c4).  i am a carb loader but the 2 months before this ive only been eating chicken/rice/sweet potatoes or steak/rice/sweet potatoes 3 meals a day and a yogurt in the morning. i do not smoke cigs, drink socially.

it all started around march 12th- extreme fatigue, and very sore (i thought i wasnt getting enough sleep)

march 13th- extreme fatigue, body very sore (had 3 double expresso and still extremely tired)

march 14th- fatigue, soreness ( i knew something was up just didnt know that these were symptoms)

march 15th- fatigue, soreness, cough (very minor cough started, i was joking around with friends that i had coronavirus)

march 16th-really bad body aches, the fatigue stepped it up 10x, minor cough (still went to work)

march 17th-fever started 100.3, chills, body aches, fatigue

march 18th- fever 100.2, chills, body aches, fatigue (found a loophole and got tested)

march 19th- no fever, body aches worsen, fatigue, but now the worst part tightness in my chest

march 20th- woke up in the middle of the night with pain in my lower back, shortness of breath, chest tightness, coughing alot more

march 21st- \*\*\*\*the worst day ive ever had in my life\*\*\*\* having trouble breathing, a lot of tightness in my chest. body aches.  (luckily i have a friend who is a physicians assistant come to my house and check my lungs which allievated a lot of my anxiety.  lungs were clear and i was not going to make an uneccessay trip to the er)

march 22nd-tightness in my chest, trouble breathing, head feeling foggy, lost all sense of smell and taste (thankgod today was a better day, my anxiety had me freaking out and i thought it was all over)

march 23rd- seemed to be on the mend, still tightness in my chest, trouble breathing, head feeling very foggy, when i get up too fast i am dizzy and out of breath (still a better day than the 21st so i am in good spirits)

march 24th- test results finally came back positive after a long wait, tightness in my chest still, fatigue, head very foggy, no sense of smell at all, i also developed a weird tickle in my sinuses. (ill take no sense of smell over the trouble i had breathing)

&#x200b;

i will continue to update if you want but these have been my day by days.  honestly to kill time ive been playing a lot of video games to help with the anxiety and listening to ""chill piano playlists"".

if you have any questions feel free to pm me.

&#x200b;

waiting for the tightness in my chest to disapear.  ive lost a total of 10lbs but i did not lose my appetite which is weird.  ive been eating like a freak and drinking a lot of water.

\*\*no i will not send you a recording of my cough\*\* sorry

foiymi,2020-03-24 23:01:00 UTC,"inspired by ascrumner, and an outlet to distract myself, i've decided to write my symptoms.

me: 32 year old female
childhood asthma, but only acts up when really sick. for example last time i used my inhaler was over a year ago.

all started the 19th, sore throat, runny nose. didn't think anything of it until i realized how swollen my throat/neck (?) glands were. i've been able to avoid coughing by drinking a lot of lemon water. anytime i felt a inkling, i would immediately take a sip.

i wouldn't have thought anything of it, but my dad started the same symptoms as me around the same time. 

my stomach began gurgling and churning around the 21st. had a bit of a wheeze and was worried asthma was acting up. on the 22nd wheezing was gone, felt good for the day.

23rd:  bad headache in the morning, from the base of my neck, up my head. coughed until i gagged, but didn't actually throw up. diarrhea came into play. headache went away by 1pm. my throat felt mor swollen than sore around 6. felt queasy after eating dinner. around 10 got a little harder to breathe, not too bad. did some breathing exercises and slept. phlegm changed from green to clear throughout the day.

24th: woke up with pain on left side , sat up to breathe. around noon, noted that i had a stuffy nose, breathing easier, greenish phlegm. played outside with my kids, felt nauseous, but i love them. 9pm hit with nausea, diarrhea, and chills. sitting on the couch with my family shaking, my poor baby got worried. hubby sent kids to bed and i laid in bed doing some breathing exercises to keep me calm.

 all symptoms stopped at 10:28. weirdest thing. 

now i'm sitting here typing this out with a dry throat, not looking forward to the next dip on this covid roller coaster.

will update as this progresses.

update1: 

25th: woke up 4am with chest and stomach pains. i don't know how long it was before i fell asleep. got up at 7am with a tightness in my chest, a slight wheeze and exhaustion. i have since eaten breakfast, throat was swollen so a struggle to swallow vitamins. 

the rest of the day i have been good. a bit lethargic, but i know this is the calm before the storm. i am worried for my dad, he's at the same stage as me.

update 2:

26th: woke up with a tightness in my chest, back aches. practicing breathing exercises which calms me down, doesn't alleviate the tightness but i'm doing something. i have a chest x-ray scheduled for today.
my dad has shortness of breath which is beyond worrying me, he's 65 years old and i want to be with him to take care of him.

27th: 12:16am got hit with fatigue around 10:30 pm and decided to try to get some rest. then around 12 i woke with this weird feeling and began to have strong chills. my whole body was just shaking. i took my temp, no fever, realized my thermometer is 2 degrees lower (so i had a low grade fever 2 days ago when it read  98). my mouth was dry and i shook for practically 15 minutes. all the time i kept thinking ""f- you virus. my body is strong."" shaking subsided, throat stopped being dry but a strong tickle in my throat developed and i was coughing for a while. the whole time my chest felt tight, but i was ok breathing. did not sleep well at all last night. been hacking up phlegm so far, chest tightness, but with my breathing exercises i'm feeling ok. 99.5 temp atm.",$$$wheezing$$$runny nose$$$headache$$$nose$$$sitting$$$before$$$diarrhea$$$fever$$$lethargic$$$exhaustion$$$coughing$$$but$$$breathing$$$diarrhea$$$fever$$$coughed$$$breathe$$$chills$$$slept$$$throat$$$but$$$nose$$$came$$$but$$$but$$$fatigue$$$shaking$$$stomach$$$tightness$$$breath$$$tight$$$throat$$$phlegm$$$breathing$$$wheeze$$$low grade fever$$$throat$$$whole$$$breathing$$$throw$$$headache$$$worried$$$thought$$$neck$$$tightness$$$breathe$$$worried$$$head$$$coughing$$$grade fever$$$but$$$nausea$$$something$$$worried$$$sitting$$$phlegm$$$breathing$$$degrees$$$stomach$$$temp$$$shaking$$$throat$$$tightness$$$phlegm$$$whole$$$before$$$throat$$$breathing$$$but$$$wheeze$$$throat$$$tightness$$$shaking$$$chills$$$temp$$$away$$$sleep$$$but$$$throat$$$breathing$$$nauseous$$$but$$$worrying$$$but$$$neck$$$stuffy nose$$$,"$$$Wheezing$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Headache$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Chest tightness$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Pyrexia$$$Lethargic$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Chills$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Chills$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Chest tightness$$$Dyspnea$$$Chest tightness$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Wheezing$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Vomiting$$$Headache$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Dyspnea$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Headache$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Nausea$$$Chest tightness$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Chest tightness$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Cough$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Wheezing$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Chills$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Nausea$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Rhinorrhea$$$",$$$C0043144$$$C1260880$$$C0018681$$$C1260880$$$C0235710$$$C0013456$$$C0011991$$$C0015967$$$C0023380$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0011991$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0085593$$$C0917801$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C1260880$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0085593$$$C0011991$$$C0235710$$$C0013404$$$C0235710$$$C2363731$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0043144$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0741585$$$C0013404$$$C0042963$$$C0018681$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0235710$$$C0013404$$$C1832070$$$C0018681$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0027497$$$C0235710$$$C1832070$$$C0235710$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C2363731$$$C0235710$$$C0010200$$$C0741585$$$C0013456$$$C2363731$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0043144$$$C2363731$$$C0235710$$$C0085593$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0013404$$$C0027497$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C1260880$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

headache (mild), strep feeling in nose, difficulty catching my breath (while sitting), pain at base of skull, heaviness in chest, cough, pain in left lung, heart palpitations, increased heart rate, tightness in throat, loss of taste and smell. temp is 99.6 (normal 96.2).

25 year old male here from florida, my girlfriend is a 30 year old female. we went on a trip to nyc back in december and we left new york on december 21. when we were at new yorkâ€™s laguardia airport waiting on our flight my girlfriend was sitting next to someone who was coughing and she literally remembers saying â€œoh great iâ€™m going to get sickâ€. when we got back, she visited her family for christmas and started developing symptoms on or around december 25/26, she got a severe dry cough and sort of a sore throat with chills. she came back on the 26th and got much worse saying that she felt like she couldnâ€™t breathe and laid in bed for most of the day. she had a visit with an online doctor and he prescribed to her benzonatenate and prednisone. after she started taking the prednisone, she started to improve but the cough stayed with her for a while like 20 days. just being in close contact with her caused me to get it, i had a low grade fever of 100.4 and at first developed a sore throat and a minor cough with a runny nose as it seemed to have affected my upper respiratory tract at first, after a week, i started to feel a pain in my chest and it was a burning pain, it got worse whenever i inhaled and exhaled, i literally felt like death on new years. i kept taking a steady dose of advil and mucinex. i went to a walk in clinic and they tested me for flu and strep, both were negative. remember when i said that she went to her parents house for christmas? her 21 year old brother with cerebral palsy got it and he got a very severe cough and could not stop coughing, he also experienced some shortness of breath. her mother who is a 63 year old chronic smoker got it and she had relatively minor symptoms at first but they got much worse. in the middle of the night she woke up in a pool of sweat and had severe shortness of breath and had to be rushed to the hospital, they diagnosed her with pneumonia in her left lung and pleurisy in both lungs. she was put on supplemental oxygen and slowly recovered. my mom got it as well and got a call from her doctor recently and was told that she probably had covid 19. i didnâ€™t even know what coronavirus was at the time and i was pretty frustrated that it was negative for the flu and strep. thank god none of us died, if that was covid 19, itâ€™s almost impossible to control because we all got infected so quickly and it was just so contagious, one of us having it turned into 4 of us having it.",$$$coughing$$$but$$$fever$$$breathe$$$sweat$$$pneumonia$$$breath$$$cough$$$grade fever$$$throat$$$cough$$$breath$$$but$$$coughing$$$strep$$$chills$$$cough$$$cough$$$came$$$respiratory$$$low grade fever$$$nose$$$strep$$$frustrated$$$runny nose$$$throat$$$burning$$$sitting$$$,$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$other$$$Dyspnea$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Chills$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Irritability$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Chest pain$$$Chest tightness$$$,$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0020458$$$C0000000$$$C0013404$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C2363731$$$C0085593$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C1260880$$$C2363731$$$C0022107$$$C1260880$$$C2363731$$$C0008031$$$C0235710$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
fp3r48,2020-03-25 22:43:00 UTC,"flew back from paris 3/8 and felt chest tightness and cough 3/9. fever in am of 3/10, 99.9. self isolated and mostly had low grade fever (99.3-100.9) and got tested 3/13, positive result a few days later. 

i had really bad headaches day 3-7, some diarrhea day 1-2, runny nose day 2-3, just all over the place. mostly the fever. i gradually began feeling better probably day 9 or so, no fever from day 10.

day 15, yesterday, i left isolation and went crazy busy cooking, cleaning a dirty house from two weeks with four kids and a busy husband. laundry, cleaning etc. felt really tired at night and had body aches. 

day 16 today felt tired in the morning and throughout day, developed a sore throat in afternoon. took temp in late afternoon to 99.8 again. ugh. back into isolation. sore throat. 

iâ€™m so disappointed because i tried to be so careful, but i came out and exposed my family to it i guess. the fever had been gone for over five days! i guess this virus stays in your system quite awhile and looks for the slightest weakening in your immune system to regain ground. ugh.

-all symptoms mild, still working while thinking prob allergies

mon 3/16 & tues 3/17 - 
(7days since onset)

-felt â€œoffâ€ cloudy thoughts,
mildly runny nose and non stop dry cough, coughing fits, starting to feel short of breath

-prob shouldâ€™ve stayed home at this point but still no fever so thought coincidental 

weds 3/18 - 

-stayed home, spoke with dr, dr says presumptive positive, swabbed by dr, regular flu negative, corona results will take longer than a week to get back

thurs 3/19-saturday 3/21  - (11days since onset)

-cough, very hard time breathing, short of breath, fatigue
debated going to hospital, talked with my dr decided to take a wait n see approach

sunday - 3/22 - 

-felt slightly better, rested all day. not too much coughing or chest tightness

mon 3/23 - 

-feel much less â€œserious sickâ€ and much worse â€œcold like sickâ€
-strep like sore throat 
-headache
-minor fatigue and muscle aches
-joint pain
-dry cough is much less 
lungs/breathing feel ok.

tues 3/24 - 
(14 days since onset) 
(7 days since tested, still no result *50,000 test back log at quest lab)

-dr is calling it â€œpresumptive positive, pending resultsâ€
also an interesting note, with the way the test is currently it only has a 70% sensitivity, meaning outside of errors 30% of potential positives will show as negative

-symptoms same as monday but much better

weds 3/25
small itchy cough still
sore throat gone!
breathing still much better
thought i was mostly better

quarantine complete / dr approved return to work.


but then weds night coughing returned bad
woke up in the middle of the night felt like i had been stabbed with a hot knife in my lungs

__

today:
thursday 3/26 - (day 16 since initial symptoms)

woke up with nonstop cough
feel fatigue/need to rest
trying to rest it off
still feel like iâ€™m on the uptick overall tho

___

of note:

-never had recorded fever

-sickness came in waves, feeling not sick at all at times, followed by different symptoms popping up, strangest type of sick

-overall sickness is very mild, with the exception of about 2 days of really bad respiratory stuff

-constants have been mild gastrointestinal stuff and fatigue

-another weird thing is several days cannot smell and taste is altered, mind cloudy, but this has improved a lot

___
also- 

-i did not take any medicines the whole time, i didnâ€™t want to mask/miss something in my lungs
*at this point will prob start taking some dayquil & otc cough medicine
**dr said do not take ibuprofen or nsaids as the can allow the virus to get deeper into lungs.

-drank lots of water, slept as much as possible, took all of the vitamins + emergency c, vit c, zinc

-ate as much as i could

__

if you are under 50, without preexisting condition, reasonable health, even if you get really sick, you prob wonâ€™t die. 

unless you are sick when we run out of beds and ventilators. 

â€”

but in the meantime, if there is someone you love and they are over 50, their prognosis rapidly declines with every year of their age. with or without beds/ventilators.

__

so... maybe do your part. not a time to panic, but def a time to lay low. 

please:
-this is serious, highly contagious and deadly

-stay home (this might take a couple more months) *at least prob

-sanitize/wash your hands

-if you go out - where a mask, gloves, sanitize (6â€™ distancing)

-cover your cough

-support each other, a lot of people are going to be hard up, so help out each other if it is in your means (letâ€™s have a village mentality)

-be kind and patient, there is an overall anxiety everywhere, *people are confined to their homes, for most of us that is not that bad, for others though it could be a nightmare 

social distancing- 
pretend you have it if you donâ€™t (you can spread it with no symptoms)
pretend everyone else has it that you come in contact with

flatten the curve:
we are not going to stop the spread of the disease. it is pretty widespread already.
but if we can slow it down enough over the next few months, we might be able to keep the hospitals from being overwhelmed and there might still be a bed and ventilators there when your grandma needs it or your mom or you.",$$$but$$$breath$$$sensitivity$$$tightness$$$nose$$$breathing short$$$sweats$$$but$$$muscle$$$fatigue$$$came$$$breath$$$cough$$$headache$$$something$$$eyes$$$cough$$$breathing$$$thought$$$panic$$$fatigue$$$diarrhea$$$respiratory$$$fever$$$cough$$$taste$$$strep$$$fever$$$cough$$$but$$$whole$$$smell$$$cough$$$coughing$$$but$$$coughing$$$coughing fits$$$ate$$$throat$$$anxiety$$$runny nose$$$gastrointestinal$$$chills$$$fever$$$cough$$$coughing$$$throat$$$fatigue$$$but$$$joint$$$throat$$$breathing$$$fatigue$$$but$$$thought$$$slept$$$cough$$$but$$$breathing$$$,"$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$other$$$Chest tightness$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Dyspnea$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Pyrexia$$$Myalgia$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Cough$$$Headache$$$Chest tightness$$$Eye pain$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Fatigue$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Ageusia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Anosmia$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Loss of appetite$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Arthralgia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$",$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0000000$$$C0235710$$$C1260880$$$C0013404$$$C0020458$$$C0015967$$$C0231528$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0010200$$$C0018681$$$C0235710$$$C0151827$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0015672$$$C0011991$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C2364111$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0003126$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0232462$$$C2363731$$$C1832070$$$C1260880$$$C0011991$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C2363731$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0003862$$$C2363731$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0917801$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
fpe7cz,2020-03-26 12:11:00 UTC,"i'm posting this as a bit of relief for myself, but also as info for other people.

bit of background on myself. i'm a male who is 31 years old - i work in an office job where i run code for the bulk of my time. everyone at work knows me as the guy who is a fitness freak. it's not uncommon for me to lead several hiit classes a week, put a decent chunk of kilometers on my running shoes and on my trusted road bike. here is my journey with covid19 up to this point.

march 7 - i started developing a dry cough and having chest tightness. the dry cough isn't uncommon for me as i have seasonal allergies. the chest tightness immediately stood out as i do have anxiety, but this was a very different feeling. i made note of it. chest pressure was constant and as if a little kitten was sitting on my chest.

this minor chest kitten continued to sit on me for the next few days, but felt well enough to continue doing sports

march 11-13 - i had offsite meetings at the base of a mountain. i got up at 6:30am and decided i wanted to run up the mountain before breakfast on march 12. logged about 90mins of cardio and felt great. repeat on the next day as well.

again the chest kitten is there but i'm excersising at my normal capacity because physically i feel like i'm not being impeeded.

march 20 - i had been riding my road bike all week as i was working from home at this point. march 20 i felt like the kitten on my chest was a bit heavier and decided i needed a rest day...

march 21 - day begins with me complaining to my wife about how my chest pressure got a lot heavier. she says i should just rest. i message a friend and we start talking and i mention my chest pressure and the pain and he says ""yup that's the worst thing about this."" i knew he had a sore throat before, but didn't realize he was also experiencing chest pain.

throughout the day my little chest kitten became bigger and bigger. from kitten to dog to adult standing on the chest to a gorilla sitting on my chest. i find myself gasping for air multiple times just getting off the couch. in the evening i call the covid hotline for help. they'll send someone over on monday for the test.

saturday night is tough as my pain gets worse and worse. the gorilla on my chest won't let up and somehow he found a wrench that he's pushing into my sternum. my hands are on 911, but it's just pain and i'm not struggling for breathe at this point. i tough it out.

march 22 - i manage to sleep a few hours in the morning as my body is exhausted from the pain of last night. when i'm awake i'm just lying in bed with a gorilla on my chest - just go away. 

march 23 - the guys come over to administer the test. they drive to my house the come up to the door with surgical gear and swab my mouth. i'm instructed to close the door while they remove all surgical gear and i'm supposed to throw it out. 

day progresses with me gasping for air multiple times and the gorilla on my chest. i've also realized that my lymphnodes are super swollen and painful. this makes it tricky to swallow food and i start getting some acid reflux.

from around 7pm-11pm i go through phases of losing breathe, gasping for air and having it seem like my lungs are on fire. we call the hotline for help and are ready to dial 911 when it seems to improve slowly.

at this point we decide that my wife will no longer sleep in a separate bed. we've packed a hospital go bag and she'll be in bed with me in case i can't get any air she would notice and call 911 right away.


march 24 - i wake up and my lungs are not on fire. the gorilla is smaller as he's turned into a dog now.

march 25 - same thing as the day before. no improvement or worsening. in fact my lungs feel like i can take deep breathes again.

downside is that throughout the day my left arm goes numb on multiple occasions. call my doctor and explain it as i'm concerned that this is now impacting my heart. turns out that it may be related to the lack of oxygen in my blood and my body is focusing on the vital organs. it may also be a rate response from nerves when your body is fighting a virus. doctor confirms that i've got covid19 and i'm not to leave my place.

march 26 - same thing with my lungs as the day before. my cough seems to be going back and my arm hasn't gone numb. found out that my friend who had similar symptoms tested negative for covid19, but he'd struggling right now too.


mentally, this has been taxing. i have no idea if there is permanent damage to my lungs or if i can expect a relapse. the first deterioration was so sudden and unexpected. i'm spending all my time in bed resting and relaxing.


i'm not sure if this is helpful for other people. i never had a fever over the past few weeks and don't know if this will be longer. this is already way longer than the standard length.

young people don't take this stuff lightly. it hurts like hell - i've torn and operated my acl and shoulder. both of these were less painful than what my lungs have gone through.

i wish everyone who has this the best. everyone who doesn't have it, please practice social distancing. it's not worth it - the damage can be severe for anyone.",$$$take deep breathes$$$sitting$$$acid$$$but$$$before$$$tightness$$$but$$$before$$$goes$$$tightness$$$arm$$$away$$$breathe$$$awake$$$painful$$$arm$$$anxiety$$$but$$$cough$$$fever$$$breathe$$$throat$$$similar$$$painful$$$sleep$$$sitting$$$but$$$cough$$$cough$$$sleep$$$before$$$throw$$$but$$$but$$$talking$$$before$$$numb$$$numb$$$but$$$away$$$,"$$$Dyspnea$$$Chest tightness$$$Nausea$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Palpitations$$$Chest tightness$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Fatigue$$$Dyspnea$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Chest pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Chest pain$$$Chest pain$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Vomiting$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$",$$$C0013404$$$C0235710$$$C0027497$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0030252$$$C0235710$$$C0741585$$$C0015672$$$C0013404$$$C0741585$$$C0008031$$$C0741585$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C2363731$$$C0008031$$$C0008031$$$C0917801$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0917801$$$C0013456$$$C0042963$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0013456$$$C0741585$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
fpf0p2,2020-03-26 12:55:00 UTC," 

i drove out here out of an abundance of caution. didnâ€™t want to risk going straight home, not with dadâ€™s age and health. my friends and i had a get together before i left school. i wasnâ€™t too worried about it- after all, no one there had it, and i was coming out here anyways. so, the plan was to spend a couple weeks out here alone in the boonies, long enough to be sure i wasnâ€™t infected.

when i say out here, i really do mean out here. woods or fields on three sides, an empty house on the fourth. an empty cabin in the woods. one store near enough, but they were sold out after the supply chains went to hell. wifi sucked, phone signal was in and out.

at first, the only thing i minded was the loneliness. had been a week without seeing another human face, which is never fun. i worked out like crazy, watched a ton of netflix, smoked a ton of weed and drank way too much to kill the boredom. took long walks in the winter woods, since spring hadnâ€™t had time to make it out here yet and there was most of a foot of snow on the ground.

the economic news wasnâ€™t great either. any time economists use phrases like â€œblack mondayâ€ three mondays in a row you know youâ€™re in deep shit. unemployment claims for the first week came to almost three and a half million people. i still had a job after graduation, i hopedâ€¦anyways, that was my biggest worry.

at first, i put the cough down to the weed. the reason it was getting worse every day was that i was smoking every night. and of course it was a dry cough, it was because the smoke was irritating my throat. made sense.

then, when my throat started to hurt and my nose stuffed up, i put it down to allergies. timing seemed about right. gotta be allergies. nothing to worry about. same with when my eye swelled shut from conjunctivitis. and if the cough was deeper now, and i was starting to cough up thick green mucus, well, that could surely be allergies too, right?

iâ€™ll be honest. thereâ€™s nothing quite like being driven to your knees from a coughing fit, and looking down to see your own blood splattered on the floor in front of you, to tell you that you probably arenâ€™t dealing with allergies.

when my first buddy tested positive, i knew that last get together had been a mistake. started reaching out to other friends whoâ€™d been exposed. one was sick, and her boyfriend had lost his sense of smell and taste. another felt like he had a weight on his chest. more were holed up at home in their rooms, terrified to come near their parents. two more of us had tested positive but were asymptomatic.

talked to a doctor over text. told me to stay out here unless i thought i was about to die. something real eerie about that. canâ€™t shake the feeling that the world is ending. and to be honest, part of me worries a little that one of these nights iâ€™ll realize iâ€™m in deep shit and be too far gone to do anything about it.

fq1s8m,2020-03-27 13:52:00 UTC,"coronavirus:
i am a healthy 26 year old female living in london, uk with no pre-existing medical conditions. i have been documenting my symptoms on the notes of my phone daily in hopes it may help others out there to distinguish coronavirus vs a cold/flu. 

it all started 3 weeks ago when my toddler daughter went to nursery for the first time. she brought home the flu and both my husband and i caught it. i was sick with classical flu symptoms for 10 days, body aches, general headaches, muscle weakness, exhaustion, nasal congestion, sneezing, light fevers etc.- and i just managed to carry on with life despite feeling rotten, definitely a flu versus a cold. i recovered and then got (what i later learnt was) a sinus infection, snot as green/ brown as it comes and impossible to breathe through my nose due to heavy congestion. then all 3 of us got hit with coronavirus, with my symptoms being the worst and my toddlerâ€™s being only just noticeable.  something to note, since getting flu over 3 weeks ago, i have not left my house once! so i must have caught coronavirus from either my husband, toddler or food/grocery/amazon deliveries. 

wednesday 18th march:
i woke up with a sore, aching body that i thought was from working out at home the day prior. but it felt odd, the pains were in my bones, specifically my hips and knees, and by the evening my throat was sore and i had almost lost my voice. i thought potentially i hadnâ€™t recovered from the flu and was having a second wind. 

thursday 19th march:
i woke up to the worst headache of my life. i felt like my brain was going to explode in my skull. like it was too big for my skull and was pushing against, swelling in my head. the pain was most noticeable at the back of my head by my neck and the front of my forehead, but was all over as if i were wearing a motorcycle helmet that was 10 sizes too small. my throat felt swollen and i was struggling to swallow. my temperature all day was 38 degrees celsius. i took paracetemal and nuforen plus (which is ibuprofen + codeine) and it didnâ€™t take one bit of the pain away. i thought i was going to die and said to my husband that if the pain doesnâ€™t disappear by the next morning i had to go to hospital, as nothing was helping this excruciating pain. we have been advised by our government to stay away from the hospitals here due to coronavirus overcrowding and i thought to myself that if this isnâ€™t coronavirus, then going to hospital will only make me catch it. so i gave myself 12 hours to see what happened. i had chills and hot flushes with a constant temperature of 38 degrees celsius all day.

friday 19th march:

i woke up and the headache was gone! but i now have green / brown snot and cannot breathe through my nose. my sore throat starts to disappear. 

saturday & sunday 20th - 21st march: 
feel tired but better, green snot and congestion still there. sore throat disappears. have diarreah all of sunday and have no sense of taste and smell both days. 

monday & tuesday 22nd - 23rd march: 
extremely tired and sore throat gets progressively worse. green brown snot still there. my bones start aching again in my hips and knees. i weigh 120 pounds and feel the same pain in my hips (almost like the sciatic nerve pain i had when 9 months pregnant). pain even when lying down. extremely odd. 
the whites of my eyes are red and i wake up with a small white gunk in my eyes. my face is also swollen. 

wednesday 25th march: *** lung symptoms develop

i wake up at 5am gasping for air. i canâ€™t breathe. as if someone has held me underwater and iâ€™m trying to breathe. my nose is completely congested and my lungs feel like an elephant is sitting on them. i can only make small breaths in and out. my lungs feel like they are half the size they usually are. 
i immediately email my private gp and ask her to call me asap and finally realise that this isnâ€™t the end of a lingering flu. 
the whites of my eyes are red still. 
i spend the day panting. the best way to describe it is as if iâ€™ve run up a flight of stairs and am trying to gasp for air at the top- but constantly. even when iâ€™m lying down. i now know this is the classical shortness of breath in coronavirus. 

after a lengthy facetime with my gp, she says i must have caught a sinus infection after having the flu and have now got coronavirus, which gets clarified later with positive test. she prescribes me azithromycin 250mg x2 once daily for 5 days for the sinus infection and a steroid nasal spray (flixonase aqueous nasal spray) to help open up my nasal passages for breathing. 
for coronavirus help, she prescribes me an inhaler to help open up my lungs when i am struggling to breathe (ventolin evohaler). 

my husband picks up the meds at the pharmacy and the inhaler helps my breathing dramatically when i am gasping for air. 
temperature sits at 38 degrees celsius all day. 

thursday 26th march:

sinuses already starting to feel better following antibiotics. i can finally breathe through my nose after using steroid nose spray plus sudafed nose spray. i have absolutely no appetite all day and have to force myself to eat. 

friday 27th march:
woke up at 10am exhausted. had no appetite but forced myself to eat half a bagel. went back to sleep and woke up at 2pm feeling extremely hot. my temperature is 38.5 degrees all day, which doesnâ€™t go down with paracetemal. 
same tightness in chest, dull headache, have slight tinnitus in both ears and phlem at the back of my throat. breathing feels better when inhaler is used. extreme exhaustion, can barely keep my eyes open all day. 
itâ€™s 5pm now and iâ€™m ready to go back to sleep but feel so hot. when i walk around the house, i pant as if iâ€™ve run a marathon. 
no cough has developed yet. 

update: at 6pm i had severe breathing difficulties, temperature of 40.5 degrees celsius, felt like i had run a marathon and was gasping for air trying to talk just one word and my husband called our gp after 45 mins who said i needed to go to hospital asap. i took paracetemal to get my temperature down on advice of my gp. on arrival in hospital they took my blood pressure, temperature, blood tests, ecg, x-ray of lungs, checked oxygen levels 2 ways and gave me supplemental oxygen while they wait for blood results to come back. my breathing got better after a few hours. they have given me clarithromycin 250mg 2 tablets twice daily & co-amoxiclav 500mg 1 tablet 3 times daily as they say theyâ€™ve been seeing covid patients develop secondary bacterial lung infections, so they want me to take them for 5 days to be safe. they said they are going to release me and if i am continuously being unable to breathe (the extreme shortness gasping of air episodes) for a few hours straight then i must come back in, but for now my oxygen levels are up and stable. the nurses and doctors were phenomenal, so kind and caring. there were 2 other young girls who came in with similar symptoms of breathing difficulties without coughing. there was also a 40+ year old woman buckled over coughing constantly, i felt awful for her. i also saw them wheel out a body, covered in a blanket. truly humbling and shocking. 

i have never felt more ill and truly understand how this can kill healthy people. the hype is sadly real ðÿ˜” hope this helps someone out there ðÿ’— stay safe, stay healthy, sanitise everything!

saturday 28th march: 

feeling extremely tired today. was woken up at 12:15pm for food and went back to sleep after and woke up at 2pm. body aching, specifically in my bones- legs, knees and hips. have a dull headache and feeling very dizzy. also slight tinnitus still. temperature is much better at 37.7 degrees celsius. took day nurse (paracetemal, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride & pholcodine) and the antibiotics they prescribed after eating a bagel. still have shortness of breath and panting lightly just lying upright in bed, but trying to stay calm. used inhaler twice so far. iâ€™m extremely grateful for all your well wishes throughout this, it made me feel much less alone to know so many of you are experiencing the same things. 
6pm: fever is back to 38 degrees, i feel freezing cold despite wrapped up in layers in bed with a hot water bottle. feel dizzy and shortness of breath is back. extremely exhausted can barely keep my eyes open and have no appetite. going to go to sleep soon. 
iâ€™ll keep you updated of my symptoms and hopefully will be recovering soon versus deteriorating ðÿ’› sending love to all

fq4vhu,2020-03-27 16:22:00 UTC,"i got the call that iâ€™m positive. current symptoms are quite mild: low grade fever, sore throat, no cough yet. i am bracing myself for things to worsen...

my question is, what if any, evidence is out there about ways to prevent pneumonia with covid-19. i do realize that this is a respiratory illness and there is likely nothing that can stop the virus from traveling to the lungs. but curious to hear other ideas/thoughts about ways to make it less destructive. 

so far iâ€™ve read:

1. drink a lot of fluids 

2. practice diaphragmatic breathing (not to prevent pneumonia, but more as a way to stop panicking and hyperventilating and making things worse)

3. spend as much time as possible being vertical. sleep with your neck propped up to prevent fluid from settling.

edit: thank you all for your replies. for more context, i had influenza a just two weeks ago. not good timing. i was just starting to feel better before i came down with my current symptoms 2 days ago. iâ€™m terrified at the prospect of not being at my strongest physically or immunity wise.",$$$fever$$$neck$$$grade fever$$$throat$$$sleep$$$but$$$cough$$$before$$$low grade fever$$$breathing$$$pneumonia$$$but$$$pneumonia$$$respiratory$$$came$$$,$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$other$$$Pyrexia$$$other$$$Dyspnea$$$Cough$$$,$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0000000$$$C0015967$$$C0000000$$$C0013404$$$C0010200$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

26th march: no fever, no more cough. nose gets stuffy, not like blocked because i can still breathe through it, just stuffy, not clear as it usually is. begins to lose sense of smell and therefore taste. 

27th march: no fever, no cough. nose still slightly stuffy. still no smell / taste. 

28th march: same.. woke up and ate breakfast. still no smell, no taste. 

i am lucky that my symptoms are mild and i am feeling really fine! itâ€™s just the loss of smell and taste thatâ€™s really frustrating (day 3 of this). read that it takes 7-14 days to come back. i will update on this as iâ€™ve seen many people talking about this. 

apart from that, i am wondering, my doctors are prescribing telfast for my stuffy / blocked nose! is anyone taking it? do you have other recommendations? telfast doesnâ€™t seem to work very well on me.",$$$throat$$$ate$$$nose$$$cough$$$taste$$$talking$$$breathe$$$throat$$$cough$$$fever$$$taste$$$cough$$$sense$$$cough$$$fever$$$nose$$$something$$$smell$$$fever$$$smell$$$smell$$$nose$$$smell$$$fever$$$cough$$$cough$$$taste$$$cough$$$taste$$$fever$$$,$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Loss of appetite$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Cough$$$Ageusia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Ageusia$$$Cough$$$Anosmia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Chest tightness$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Anosmia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Ageusia$$$Cough$$$Ageusia$$$Pyrexia$$$,$$$C2363731$$$C0232462$$$C1260880$$$C0010200$$$C2364111$$$C2363731$$$C0013404$$$C2363731$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C2364111$$$C0010200$$$C0003126$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C1260880$$$C0235710$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0003126$$$C1260880$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C2364111$$$C0010200$$$C2364111$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
fqjmfm,2020-03-28 08:51:00 UTC,"me: 27m, overweight, otherwise no pre existing conditions. emt/dispatcher in ma, live in nh.

day 1 - fatigue. worked a 16 hour shift and just figured it was not getting enough sleep or whatever.

day 2 - scratchy throat. didnâ€™t think anything of it. still felt tired at points.

day 3 - fatigue came back. worked a shift til 11pm and had another one at 7am the next day. 

day 4 - woke up with a fever. nothing measured on thermometer but i question itâ€™s accuracy. on and off feelings of fever, fatigue, and chills. now waking up every hour or so at night.

day 5 - diarrhea first thing in the morning. otherwise the same symptoms as yesterday. 

day 6 - worst day yet. felt extra fatigued all day. had am diarrhea again and the on and off feverish feeling kept coming back.

day 7 - felt like i was getting better. still had am runs but otherwise i felt alright. no appetite. still slept like shit that night. also noticed little pains when i take a deep breath. 

day 8 - woke up with the runs yet again. but still felt alright! ended up getting tested in shrewsbury. felt nice to leave the house. felt my heart race towards night time. nothing extreme but 100-110bpm. always feel feverish when i go and lay down for bed. it sucks.

day 9 - you guessed it! am runs. felt run down most of the day. lost my appetite again. went to bed and felt hot but got a burning feeling in my chest. awful acid reflux. lasted all night. had weird dreams. 

day 10 - woke up and still had the burning feeling but it subsided about 2 hours into my day. also started to read that this is because of the irritation in my chest. no appetite but i forced down some toast and soup throughout the day. got extremely fatigued around 5pm and noticed a slight heaviness in my chest when i sat or laid down. either way went to bed and sort of propped myself up when i slept and that helped with the burning feeling but i still slept like trash.

day 11 (this morning) - woke up at 630 and felt decent. heart still tachy with on and off chest tightness. felt some very minor shortness of breath but itâ€™s since subsided. iâ€™m up and walking around and feel a bit better when i do. started taking 2000mg of vitamin c a day per a healthcare friend. the shortness of breath made me anxious. should i be worried itâ€™s going to get more severe?



to add: iâ€™m doing this alone. it sucks. itâ€™s taxing. but i think itâ€™s good i donâ€™t have a cough or sore throat. still have my sense of taste and smell. iâ€™m a pot smoker only at night before bed. obviously cut the shit once this all started. anyone else with a similar progression thatâ€™s recovered or currently dealing with the same shit?


ps - anyone ever use cbd at night to help with sleep? does it work? iâ€™ve tried benadryl and it does not work at all.

fqrh88,2020-03-28 16:09:00 UTC,"how did the chest pains feel like and where did you feel it (sternum, etc)? was it a sharp pain when you move or constant? is your heartbeat fast? 

i think iâ€™m just being anxious and it maybe not be covid-19. i do have an occasional cough to clear what feels like a tickle or scratch around my throat. i do have sore throat as well from march 10 until now.

update: i was able to do a call with a doctor. since my sore throat and occasional coughs passed 14 days with no fever he said i probably didnâ€™t have covid-19.

presently, i am getting more chest pains (sometimes a sharp pain, most of the time a pressure on my entire chest, but more on my left). he said it could be a chest cold (sore throat was more likely viral then went into my chest). with my multiple respiratory issues growing up (acute bronchitis, tonsillitis, pneumonia and tb), iâ€™m still monitoring and in self isolation again.

fqz3q9,2020-03-28 23:37:00 UTC,"i have medical anxiety, so yâ€™all can only imagine how iâ€™m handling this situation right about now. i just want someone to hold my hand and tell me iâ€™m gonna make it through this. but you know, social distancing and all. anyway, hereâ€™s a breakdown of my symptoms. 

day 1- last saturday night 
i had that headache thatâ€™s been constantly described in this community, thought it was a pms migraine, although nothing dulled it. slept it off. had no idea i was sick 

day two- went to work (essential employee, now on medical leave) and i had a hot flash type of thing where i got real shaky. felt like i had a fever and my tummy hurt a bit, but it all went away. felt otherwise fine 

day three- very sleepy. very very sleepy. 

day 4- tuesday
this was the day i suspected something was up.  exposed my darling boyfriend (sorry hunny bun) and i feel so guilty. i was fine until late in the day when i started feeling like i was coming down with a flu. started to get a little anxious, had the urge to cough like twice. chalked it up to anxiety and slept through the night. 

day 5-
slight chest tightness, the tightness has mostly been in my throat and it felt like i had been screaming the day before. very lethargic and weak, took everything i had in me to put my hair up in a ponytail and take my pup for a walk. i think i slept most of that day too. i also called out of work and said iâ€™d be out at least 14 days. 

day 6- same tiredness thatâ€™s been trending for me the past days, started to get gi symptoms. mostly nausea. fever has been at a constant 99.

day 7- felt somewhat normal, fever still at 99. thought i was kinda on the upswing and got my first shortness of breath at night when i laid down. of course that triggered my anxiety but i took some melatonin and powered through. 

day 8 (this past day)- 
worst day iâ€™ve had so far. this is somehow the only day iâ€™ve not slept for like 16 hours. felt completely fine in the morning, and then the shortness of breath hit and i actually had to take my albuterol inhaler from like 2 years ago. also had a lot of chest tightness and some pain, took some acetaminophen for that, and finally bit the bullet and called my doctor for testing. doctor is sure i have it, i tested negative for the flu. still have some shortness of breath while typing, and my throat and chest feel tight. no cough, just throat clearing like the grumpy old lady i am now. 

edit:
day 9- woke up and itâ€™s the left side of my chest that feels tight, and the pain is radiating into my left arm. read about this virus affecting the heart and causing it to swell even in healthy young people. probably going to the er to get checked out. so far i have no other symptoms but they usually show up as the day progresses. 

iâ€™m really hoping this is the worst of it. i know iâ€™m definitely over dramatic about this whole thing, iâ€™ve dealt with worse sickness so far (knock on wood) but the whole anxiety about this virus being so unpredictable and not knowing whatâ€™s coming next is really doing a number on my anxiety. iâ€™m scared iâ€™ll wake up not being able to breathe or something. i have a humidifier running on my nightstand and iâ€™m staying hydrated and attempting to stay distracted any way possible. i just want some reassurance that iâ€™ll be okay i guess. thanks for reading my ramble, i wish all of you the best of health and a speedy recovery. <3

edit - day 14 update
i didnâ€™t sleep very well last night. my chest still hurts and i have a lot of gi symptoms going on and iâ€™m very weak and shaky out of nowhere. my nose has been stuffed up but it almost feels as though itâ€™s the nasal passages that are swollen rather than there being any mucus. my pulse ox still reads fine, i feel super sick to my stomach. as of now (9:45am) my temperature is 98.8. iâ€™m really terrified right now that iâ€™m making a turn for the worse. i really hope thatâ€™s not the case but i guess weâ€™ll have to wait and see. my birthday is in 5 days, i thought with the way i was headed before that i might feel normal by then.",$$$breath$$$stomach$$$slept$$$before$$$thought$$$thought$$$mucus$$$breathe$$$tightness$$$lethargic$$$arm$$$before$$$but$$$weak$$$anxiety$$$anxious$$$anxiety$$$something$$$nose$$$breath$$$sleepy$$$slept$$$but$$$but$$$tightness$$$fever$$$sleep$$$but$$$cough$$$anxiety$$$gi$$$tightness$$$something$$$ox$$$but$$$temperature$$$anxiety$$$anxiety$$$nasal passages$$$nasal$$$reading$$$weak$$$breath$$$headache$$$migraine$$$tiredness$$$slept$$$tight$$$throat$$$throat$$$slept$$$nausea$$$fever$$$thought$$$scared$$$whole$$$sleepy$$$whole$$$throat$$$but$$$fever$$$tight$$$gi$$$but$$$away$$$cough$$$,"$$$Dyspnea$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$other$$$Dyspnea$$$Chest tightness$$$Lethargic$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Chest tightness$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Dyspnea$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Chest tightness$$$Chest tightness$$$other$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Dyspnea$$$Headache$$$Migraine$$$Fatigue$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Chest tightness$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Nausea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$",$$$C0013404$$$C0011991$$$C0917801$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0000000$$$C0013404$$$C0235710$$$C0023380$$$C0741585$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C1832070$$$C1832070$$$C1832070$$$C0235710$$$C1260880$$$C0013404$$$C0917801$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C1832070$$$C0011991$$$C0235710$$$C0235710$$$C0000000$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C1832070$$$C1260880$$$C1260880$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0013404$$$C0018681$$$C0149931$$$C0015672$$$C0917801$$$C0235710$$$C2363731$$$C2363731$$$C0917801$$$C0027497$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0741585$$$C0917801$$$C0741585$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C0011991$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
fqzfk3,2020-03-29 00:00:00 UTC,"wanted to share my somewhat mild case of covid and offer some insight about the cases that arenâ€™t horror stories like the media has been depicting, and maybe offer some hope to those that are very afraid/ anxious about this virus. 

hello everybody! iâ€™m from nyc, officially tested positive for covid, free to answer any questions or just talk / share support. 

timeline of symptoms:

sunday: my mother [44f] tested positive for covid (her symptoms were only coughing and headache, no fever). i tested negative on this day. 

monday: no new developments 

tuesday: little brother [18m] tested positive for covid, shows no symptoms besides stuffy nose and these are the only symptoms he has shown so far to this day

wednesday: i started developing a sore throat, felt a bit more painful than a usual mild sore throat

thursday: woke up with 102 degree fever, body aches in my legs, felt congested, no coughing / sneezing. got tested for covid again today and tested positive. i was bed bound all day. 

friday: woke up feeling much better , no more fever or body aches. only feeling congested with some slight coughing/ sneezing, and ear/ eye aches, was able to walk/run easily and function completely normally.  feeling like i just have an ordinary cold. 

saturday: congested sinuses making my eyes/ ears hurt more, some more sneezing but not much coughing, lost my sense of taste/ smell , still able to walk/ run/ exercise perfectly fine and function normally. still feeling like itâ€™s an ordinary cold.  

[update] sunday : still congested and canâ€™t taste/ smell, no other symptoms besides this since sunday. 

i wanted to share some insight with those experiencing a lot of anxiety/ fear about covid. although this virus is very scary and can definitely be deadly in some cases i just wanted to let people know that all the horror stories you hear about on the news/ internet are definitely not representative of all covid cases (not to say there arenâ€™t any horrible cases, of course there are thousands of them) but from my personal experience with most of my neighbors and family having covid i have realized that the virus is definitely not as scary or dangerous as the media has made it out to be. some cases may be more/less mild but overall most people feel just like theyâ€™re just getting over the common flu or even an ordinary cold like me.

frh0q2,2020-03-29 20:47:00 UTC,"physician here (verified on /r/askdocs), but i am not posting (or offering) medical advice, just attempting to clarify terminology.  i'm sitting here riding out my symptomatically rather rough covid-19 infection without much better to do.

fever is a cardinal symptom of covid-19 pneumonia, present in 50-80% of cases depending on the report.  for this reason, the measurement and reporting of body temperature should be done with care.  the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_body_temperature) at the time of this writing is reasonably good (although some of the english is poor).  

the short version is that the *average* normal oral body temperature for adults is 98.6 (or slightly lower), but typically ranges from 97 - 100 in response to many factors including sex, time of day, relationship to recent meal, and - very importantly - the way it is measured.  in my notes on a patient, they need a temp of at least 100.5 (38c) for me to record ""elevated temp"".

please continue reporting measured temps, but indicate how they were measured and refrain from calling anything above 98.6 a ""fever"".  that just isn't right and results in undue concern.",$$$temperature$$$but$$$fever$$$sitting$$$but$$$temp$$$fever$$$temp$$$temperature$$$pneumonia$$$but$$$,$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$other$$$Pyrexia$$$,$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0000000$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

chest pain, pnemonia, can't breath, mind issues, fatigue, diarihia, nasua, stuffy nose sometimes, rapid breathing rarely, circulation issues, maybe bladder issues.

haven't gone to doctor yet, brothers friend works in icu and said basically only come if you are really bad.  i am obv severe, can't breath for 10 days, but don't think they will admit me.  not sure if they should either, honestly just want the med, but i know they only give it to icu folks.  

trying to stay strong, but having trouble the last several hours.  every day i get my shit together, and lose it every night.  i always hope it'll be over by the end of the day but it hasn't been the case yet.

frz9zi,2020-03-30 17:07:00 UTC,"hey everyone, iâ€™m a healthy, 25yo male (o+ blood type) and iâ€™m posting my symptom log for you all to study. i was tested on my 3rd day of symptoms and was confirmed positive. biggest red flag for me was the extreme fatigue, high hr, and constant feeling of being out of breath. iâ€™m an ironman triathlete, so when i say i was out of breath, just imagine how your parents/grandparents would feel! 

i think itâ€™s important to share that the fatigue really keyed me into being unwell, as most coverage of the symptoms seems to focus on fever/cough (which really didnâ€™t develop for me until day 3). please be cautious during these early days, and if you develop fatigue donâ€™t automatically attribute it to a poor nightâ€™s sleep/hangover/etc. listen to your body and let things develop (or not develop) before you think youâ€™ve been infected - you could be infecting others! but the easiest and best thing to do is stay home!

i seen some confusion on this sub about the meaning of shaking chills and sweats.   there are many diseases characterized by alternating episodes of bone-jarring shaking chills, and bedsheet-soaking drenching sweats.  there's really nothing clearly diagnostic about these symptoms with respect to covid-19, and many people with not have either symptom with their infection.  but understanding their significance can help you manage them and feel better if you do.

* shaking chills - don't confuse this symptom with shivering, which is what happens to you when you are cold.  shaking chills occur when your body is attempting to **increase** its temperature.  the extra muscle activity is very effective at this.  taking your temp during the chills may not tell you your peak temp, but shortly afterwards will more closely reflect your peak temp.

* drenching sweats - don't confuse this symptom with the sweating that you do when you exert yourself.  it is not a sign of fever.  rather this is a sign that your body is trying to return to a normal temp after a period of fever.

why does this matter?  if you are having shaking chills, you should be taking medications (tylenol, nsaids) to suppress them.  some have thought that your body is more effective at resisting infection when its temp is elevated, but this has never been shown to make a meaningful difference, and suppressing fevers has never been shown to be harmful.  quite the opposite - fevers are dangerous, and critical cell types do not work well at elevated temps. for the person going through shaking chills, it is just not clinically acceptable to cool the body with alcohol or ice water.  so, the best recourse is antipyretics such as tylenol or nsaids.   the manufacturer's recommended dosages are sufficient - no one should exceed these recommendations.

it is important, though, to load up on these medications before an episode of chills - start a regular dosing in advance of chills, not in response to them.

sweats - welcome them!  they are not pleasant, but your body is returning to normal, and a cool shower not only feels good, but can hasten a return to normal.",$$$chills$$$sweating$$$temp$$$shaking$$$but$$$temp$$$before$$$chills$$$sweats$$$chills$$$temp$$$fever$$$bone$$$fever$$$chills$$$temp$$$thought$$$muscle$$$chills$$$chills$$$fevers$$$shivering$$$chills$$$but$$$shaking$$$shaking$$$temp$$$sweats$$$chills$$$confusion$$$but$$$chills$$$shaking$$$shaking$$$sweats$$$but$$$fevers$$$temperature$$$shaking$$$sweats$$$but$$$,$$$Chills$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Chills$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Myalgia$$$Chills$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Chills$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Chills$$$Chills$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Pyrexia$$$,$$$C0085593$$$C0020458$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0085593$$$C0020458$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0231528$$$C0085593$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0020458$$$C0085593$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C0085593$$$C0085593$$$C0020458$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C0020458$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

woke up last monday with a scratchy throat and inability to catch my breath - biggest symptom was extreme tiredness and fatigue - i woke up after 12 hours and felt like i had not gotten any rest at all and went back to sleep.  spent about 15 hours total sleeping, still felt extremely tired.  had a \~100.5f fever that evening, but it subsided within an hour.  called my doctor who advised me to stay quarantined for 14 days.  i live with my father in his 60's so very worried about him getting ill, but they would not give either of us a test and said to stay home and don't come to the hospital unless it is a life-threatening emergency.

most symptoms have been relatively minor and are transient - they are at their worst in the very late night/early mornings, where it feels like i can't fully catch my breath, but today and yesterday had no symptoms at all mid-day besides minor shortness of breath and minor spurts of pain in my chest when i move suddenly or lie on my side.  very minor cough, subtle headaches behind my eyes, and an 'acid reflux' kind of feeling, but the cough is very dry - there is no mucus or phlegm like when i normally cough, which was my first sign that something was really wrong.  tonight has been the worst so far in terms of breathing difficulties.  small tickle in the back of my throat, and breathing was mostly fine today until about 1 am.  debated going to the emergency room around 4 but decided not to go.  

i am worried that my father will come to the hospital too, and if he's not already infected from me, he will get infected from the germs in the hospital - and from what i understand there isn't much they can do other than put you on a ventilator if you're about to die.   it's weird because i know i'm sick but i've never felt like this before - everyone in my family is trying to say it's allergies or a cold, but there is no phlegm from a cough, and being unable to get a satisfying breath is so annoying.  the worst part is that you feel completely fine for some parts of the day to the point you think you're over it - then it hits you like a truck in late night/early morning.  it also feels like because of what we've seen in the news, it should be way worse with constant pain and coughing, but for me, it is really just an overwhelming feeling of tiredness.  i can see this getting very bad very quickly though, since i am having to take pretty deep breaths and still don't feel satisfied from it.

by day 14, the only remaining symptoms were: a dry cough and pretty painful digestive issues. 

after i broke my fever on day 10, it was gone for good. 

by day 17 or 18, i was really just battling the digestive issues. i stopped taking my medications (i completed the antibiotics after 6 days, but i stayed on the antihistamines and pain killers for about a full 10-14 days). 

a summary of my digestion issues: 

if i'm remembering correctly, i had diarrhea for almost the entire duration of the sickness. my day 10, i was pretty constipated, however. by day 12, i'd developed some extreme bloating. my abdomen was so distended that i couldn't wear pants or sit down comfortably without being in a lot of pain. 

my abdominal pain was mostly located on my left side. i started taking simethicone for bloating, which would relieve the pain for a few hours at a time. when it worsened, i visited the doctor's. they were unable to give me any additional medication other than a stool softener. however, i expressed to them i was able to have bowel movements, but i was unable to pass any gas. bowel movements were difficult, but not impossible. they just happened on their own (no pushing would really work; sorry if that's tmi). 

i took matters into my own hands and just bought a generic probiotic. it's been 3 days of that; i've almost returned to normal! 

thanks for everyone who has checked up on me. glad to report life is returning back to a state of normalcy (somewhat). 

i was cleared to go outside (i'd quarantined for 14+ days), but i'm still social distancing responsibly.

fsm569,2020-03-31 17:49:00 UTC,"i was really sick last week and i was so nervous that perhaps it was just a flu, and i was still susceptible to contracting the coronavirus. i know it would just wipe me out. 
i know a lot of people are curious about what the symptoms were:

my state when into lockdown last saturday (3/21). 

monday (3/23) - normal day working from home. at 8 pm i'm watching a show and suddenly i know i'm sick. my throat hurts a bit and i start to have body aches and maybe a fever

tuesday (3/24) - a total blur of body aches, fever, chills, sore throat. it really feels like a flu.

wednesday (3/25) - temp is hovering above 98f. i have a wet cough and lingering aches. solved with tylenol. feels like a cold or bronchitis. 

thursday (3/26) - i feel a lot better though i still have a cough. im painting, cleaning my room, getting extra work done, but at night my head starts pounding

friday (3/27) - my headache is so bad and tylenol isn't helping. feel like a sinus headache bc i'm beginning to lose my sense of smell and taste.  i still have a wet cough. i can barely work from home i just passively listen to the group calls while i lay in bed

saturday (3/28) to sunday (3/29) - headache is gone but no sense of smell/taste. still have a wet cough. my ears hurt and ring, it feels like my head is suspended in sinus fluid

monday (3/30) to present (3/31) - no cough, no smell or taste. no appetite except for a need for starchy pizza/ toast (i'm still on keto so i settled for cauliflower pizza, not like i could taste it anyway). 

overall it felt like a flu.. no shortness of breathe that i noticed anyway since i spent the whole week in bed. 

 i managed to continue getting my work done from home. i didn't expose anyone at work bc i haven't been the the office since early march.  i also stuck to my keto diet and intermittent fasting about 80% of the time. pretty proud about that.

good luck everyone stay safe!

edit: adding symptoms

edit: how did i get tested? my mom runs a small family practice in ny. the labs she works with made test kits available and are replacing them for her with every patient she swabs. if you feel ill, you call ahead and line up in your car outside the clinic and she does an hour of drive thru swabbing with her team.

fsskse,2020-04-01 00:24:00 UTC,"symptoms first appeared a week ago - low grade fever, severe headaches, dry cough, congestion, occasional diarrhea, severe headaches, chest pain, and occasional shortness of breath. i have had no known contact with a confirmed case, and only go one place, which is work (in a healthcare facility). i inquired about a test via an online service as we are instructed not to present ourselves to the hospital or clinic. i was â€œevaluatedâ€ and diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection, or a cold. i called into work everyday since my symptoms appeared given the fact that coronavirus is going around and i preferred to err on the side of caution in an attempt to protect others. on saturday, i inquired about a test again via the same online service because my symptoms were becoming worse. this time, i received a different npâ€™s evaluation in which she diagnosed me with a â€œflu-like illnessâ€. because of my symptoms, and working in healthcare, she directed me to go to a drive-thru testing site in which i would be tested for influenza, and if negative, covid19. i was tested on sunday, and my influenza came back negative the same day. on monday i was called and notified i have tested positive for covid19. i have no underlying health conditions and am otherwise healthy. i would consider my case â€œmildâ€, however i am reading that the second phase of the illness is worse. tonight, i have been feeling dizzy, and all i have done is lay around. i have been extremely anxious since i was informed i tested positive due to the fact there is so much uncertainty. i am terrified to spread it to my husband and children, even though i probably already have. 

i wanted to post this not only to share my symptoms and experience thus far but to encourage anyone who truly believes they should be tested to be an advocate for themselves and their health. i will update if anyone cares to listen or just wants to talk about everything. iâ€™ve been following the news and updates vigilantly on covid19 since it first started in wuhan and could use the company.

update: day 9, today. no fever, however i can feel the infection in my lymph nodes around my groin, under my armpits, and especially my neck. my neck is swollen and extremely sore. my entire back aches, especially between my shoulder blades. i am exhausted. my chest pain has increased and it feels like both sides are alternately being stabbed. i would label this day as the worst so far. i cannot imagine feeling any worse than this. my teeth also hurt. 

i was told by a coworker yesterday that a patient where i work was the first covid19 death in our county. i was told today the whole unit i work on is infected and not doing well. i am sad and angry. many people whom i cared for who i will not get to say goodbye to... many people who i advocated for a month and a half ago when people told me i was over-reacting when i said were not being proactive.... 

i will continue to update.

update day 10: i feel better in terms of my throat is less sore and feel as if i am coughing less. i feel as if my voice is almost back to normal, however can still feel the congestion in my chest and nasal passage. the chest pain seems to have let up a bet but is still there. still have occasional shortness of breath. severe headaches ongoing. the lymph node pain is still noticeably there, if not worse. i noticed i could feel it more in my left arm/palm/fingers today too. i am so exhausted. tried taking a bath today and fell asleep in it. tried to eat some supper and fell asleep after taking a couple of bites. the fatigue is reminiscent of when i had mononucleosis back when i was a teenager.  i talked to my doctor today via a virtual visit and i asked him when i would feel better. he said i should feel better each day, and earliest iâ€™ll start to feel â€œnormalâ€ again is 6 weeks, and to allow up to three months to be back to my baseline. this worries me.

day 20??!!: i have not updated in a while so i thought i would today after being fever free for 72 hours this weekend. this morning the fever has returned. i have shortness of breath and a dry cough again too. i have no idea when this is going to end. my chest pain is worse than it was, especially in my upper stomach/below my ribs? googling this just leads to symptoms of a heart attack, which just freaks me out. i also have noticeably dull pain in the lower right quadrant of my back (where one of my kidneys are located), and have dealt with a kidney infection before - feels very similar. i probably sound like a hypochondriac reporting all of this, but these are my symptoms. iâ€™m very scared and unsure of whatâ€™s to come. :(",$$$coughing$$$respiratory$$$headaches$$$cough$$$everyday$$$breath$$$nasal passage$$$headaches$$$nodes$$$ribs$$$but$$$angry$$$diarrhea$$$eat$$$neck$$$arm$$$cough$$$came$$$headaches$$$throat$$$voice$$$breath$$$but$$$dizzy$$$before$$$fever$$$nasal$$$breath$$$scared$$$thought$$$low grade fever$$$fever$$$neck$$$stomach$$$reading$$$fatigue$$$kidney$$$anxious$$$fever$$$but$$$fever$$$grade fever$$$whole$$$similar$$$,"$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Headache$$$Cough$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Dyspnea$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Headache$$$Lymphadenopathy$$$Chest pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Irritability$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Loss of appetite$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Headache$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Dyspnea$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Abdominal pain$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Chest pain$$$",$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0018681$$$C0010200$$$C1832070$$$C0013404$$$C1260880$$$C0018681$$$C0497156$$$C0008031$$$C0015967$$$C0022107$$$C0011991$$$C0232462$$$C0741585$$$C0741585$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0018681$$$C2363731$$$C2363731$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C1260880$$$C0013404$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0011991$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0000737$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0008031$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

i saw this and our (usa... fuck) response to it hurdling us towards the deep end of a really messy pool back in february. everyone kept saying it was a matter of time before everyone got this so i began to journal mid-february about my thoughts, feelings, etc. to covid19. 

yesterday was my covid19 positive birthday from quarantine. my wife arranged a zoom meeting of 12 of my friends from many states to sing me happy birthday over my morning coffee. i died. it was amazing. i love her...

what a wild time this is huh? i have also, like many of you, lost all of my jobs. i am two things - an asl interpreter for colleges which won't be in physical session until august at the earliest and i am also a circus performer which intimately requires large groups of people for shows. i've been trying to do live performances and interpreting but with little traction so far. 

anyway... 

here is the important section for you. 

...

while my wife's test came back negative we are not permitted out of the house for 2 weeks starting yesterday. 

i've already talked to everyone who i have been around for the past month. i know where i've been, i know who sneezed near me, i know which grocery clerk licked her fingers to separate bags, i know at least 4 possible places this came from but ultimately that doesn't matter.

here is what i am going through, if anyone needs to reach out i'm happy to talk. 

\*day 1 sat 3.21\* 

i started to get aches i wasnâ€™t used to. joints mostly. things started to ache in weird ways. as a sufferer of degenerative disc disease i am intimately familiar with my body and it's relationship to pain. these pains were not in any way normal. 

\*day 2 sun 3.22\* 

same. 

\*day 3 mon 3.23\* 

7:21 dry cough started and continued for about 72 hours. fever tremors began. couldn't get warm under any amount of clothing, blankets or hot showers.

\*day 4 tues 3.24 the absolute worst day of all of them...\*

around 11am my fever started to show and this whole day was bananas. apparently my digital thermometer was broke and reading between 2-4 degrees off. i registered a fever of 107, then 105, then 106, 107, etc. etc.. 

i contacted some friends and everyone was scared. but i've had a 105 before, i knew what it felt like so i waited for a new thermometer. dad brought me one, didn't come anywhere close to the door, just left it on the step and stood across the street. my wife got the thermometer and talked to him (yelled to him) back and forth through the door across the street. 

fever was still a mess though. 100, 101, 102, 100, 101, just bouncing between those numbers. 

i would fall asleep for 2 hours only to be woken up to rush to the bathroom with diarrhea. this process of 2 hours sleep, fever check and then destroying my bathroom lasted for about 72 hours. 

a close friend of my wife's and mine dropped off a bunch of gatorade and pedialyte for me. damn life saver she is. had to drink my weight in pedialyte for at least 2 days. 

\*day 5 wed 3.25\* 

same as tues but about \*half as much\*. 

i called my pcp and he scheduled us tests at noon on thursday day 6.

my sense of smell and taste have entirely disappeared - they are just gone. i mean gone. anosmia it's called, right? i can't taste or smell anything at all. 

\* day 6 thurs 3.26\* 

was like, eh, this sucks but, ok i'm feeling like i'm climbing out of this hole. boy i wish i could stop coughing. 

i would tie a bandana around my neck and cough into it every time i needed to. washed and swapped them out daily.

\*upmc testing center is efficient af...\*

literally from getting out of my car, going into the hospital, getting tested, leaving and getting into my car was 5 minutes.

they are kind, they are quick, they are efficient, empathetic and on point in every way. 

sorry about your comfort level though - the test is a cotton swab up your nose where they swab goes alllllll the way back to the inside-your-head-wall to get snot to test. 

\*day 7 fri 3.27\* 

slight coughing without a fever. but then chest tightness started to occur. this was pretty nerve wracking. i imagine it felt like i was having an asthma attack. but i got through it. talking to people during this moments really made me think about it more and feedback loop into panic breaths. do not feedback loop into panic breathing!!! 

nothing debilitating, i've been in touch with my pcp, i'm ok for now. 

\*day 8 sat 3.28\*

a new kind of cough has started, something that feels like a chest punch, my breath is labored, i canâ€™t make it up the stairs without my breath getting short. again though, talked with my doctor and this is nowhere near as bad as it could be. 

\*day 9 sun 3.29\*

the breathlessness of steps is still happening but i do not feel like i am near deaths door, i feel decent every other way besides the lungs now. the coughing sucks. 

\*day 10 mon 3.30\*

i'm a little out of breath here and there. i'm coughing into my bandana here and there. i think i'm getting out of this.

\*day 11 tues 3.31\*

today is my birthday and i feel like i'm done with the whole covid19. no fever, no cough, no breathlessness. hilarious to have this all clear up today! 

\*day 12 wed 4.1\*

today! i feel pretty good! i've coughed twice since i woke up. no fever for days. i'm hungry. i've been hungry a few days and my sense of taste is \*almost\* back. 

...

&#x200b;

i hope this helps anyone feel a little more at ease. 

i'm good. 

here's to your health.

day 13 so far. this virus is truly insane. if i live, i have no idea how long this will take, or how or when to go get treatment. i was sure i was having a heart attack, turned out i was ok. hospital staff was cool but not sure if they would want me to come again. blah. still a bit worried about other organs including kidneys, but heart is weak organ so glad that is doing ok so far.

more than anything i just feel uber confused. like for a few days i had this feeling i was getting better, even with bad swings. but last night was a real bad one where i thought i was going to die. thought i was over that.

**what is known**: coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) most commonly presents with respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and sore throat. however, digestive symptoms also occur in patients with covid-19 and are often described in outpatients with less severe disease.in this study, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics, results of stool testing for viral rna, and outcomes of covid-19 patients with digestive symptoms and mild disease severity.

**what is new here**: we describe a unique sub-group of covid-19 patients with low severity disease marked by presence of digestive symptoms. these patients are more likely to test positive in stool for covid-19 rna, to have a longer delay before viral clearance, and to experience delayed diagnosis compared to patients with respiratory symptoms but no digestive symptoms. in some cases, the digestive symptoms, particularly diarrhea, can be the initial presentation of covid-19, and may only later or never present with respiratory symptoms or fever. these data emphasize that patients with new-onset digestive symptoms after a possible covid-19 contact should be suspected for the illness, even in the absence of cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, or fever.

this seems interesting as i'm on day 9 of pissing out my ass, tested negative, and have had basically zero respiratory symptoms (knocking on wood big time).

ftqcd5,2020-04-02 13:19:00 UTC,"i'm a 26 year old female in usa.

past medical history: developed asthma after i had really bad bronchitis in 9th grade. my asthma has only been well controlled for the past few years, before then i would be at the hospital constantly with low oxygen and asthma attacks. i'm on albuterol and symbicort 2 puffs twice a day. here is my symptoms timeline:

03/24: cough developed. sweated a lot, but i'm typically sweaty. temperature of 99.5 

03/25: cough, but passed daily checkpoint screening to be allowed to work that shift. severe headache and body aches started around 2ish, no temp in the morning but at night it was around 102, only dipping a little bit after tylenol. sense of smell started to diminish. i called my doc and this was my last day of work.

03/26: cough, sore throat, headache, body aches especially middle of upper back, fever of 100-101, slept horribly because i was in so much pain and felt horrible. lost sense of taste and smell completely. 

03/27: took my very uncomfortable test at the hospital, where it felt like they shoved a footlong cotton swab thru my nose and into my brain lol. same symptoms as the day before, temp steady at around 100 except on tylenol for pain. first case reported at work. also started having diarrhea for the next couple days.

i dont really remember the next few days much, but my fever went away, the cough progressed more, i slept like 16 hours a day and my whole immediately family sadly got sick as well. 

i got the call back this morning that the test came back positive, which i was positive (haha a pun) i had it anyway. at some point i had horrible pressure in my head/sinuses and my eyeballs felt like they were gonna pop out and my ears were so clogged i felt like i was on an airplane and couldnt hear anything but was also very sensitive to any noise.

regardless of the asthma, though, i should do just fine. i'm currently needing my inhaler more and produce a thick green mucus when i cough and it's getting harder to bring back up and my fever might be coming back so we have to watch to make sure it doesnt progress into pneumonia, but this was the extent of it.",$$$but$$$cough$$$but$$$cough$$$headache$$$temperature$$$sense$$$but$$$taste$$$smell$$$before$$$cough$$$slept$$$but$$$mucus$$$whole$$$nose$$$sinuses$$$headache$$$throat$$$but$$$diarrhea$$$away$$$cough$$$came$$$fever$$$head$$$temp$$$fever$$$sense$$$pneumonia$$$smell$$$cough$$$sweaty$$$before$$$but$$$temp$$$slept$$$fever$$$ears$$$,$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Ageusia$$$Anosmia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Cough$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$other$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Headache$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$other$$$Anosmia$$$Cough$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$,$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C2364111$$$C0003126$$$C0013456$$$C0010200$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0000000$$$C0741585$$$C1260880$$$C0948596$$$C0018681$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0000000$$$C0003126$$$C0010200$$$C0020458$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
ftu1t7,2020-04-02 16:38:00 UTC,"m, 41, sf, usa-  healthy otherwise.

sunday 3/22 noticed scratchy throat, had headache, aches, slight shortness of breath and mild cough. after 3 days i felt totally fine and shook it off as a regular cold. was in denial that i could've contracted it, as had been careful about contact, hand-washing, distancing, etc.

saturday 3/28 i lost my sense of taste and smell suddenly. also had uncomfortably sore legs which i saw mentioned once. still mostly feeling fine, minor sinus pressure and pinched airway but still no fever, so still unsure but feeling more likely.

tuesday 3/31 i was able to see my doctor and he sent me to get a test, i thought it was weird because i didnt ask or want one. 20 minutes later i drove to a hospital parking lot and got a swab much further up my nose than i thought was possible.

thursday 4/2 results came back positive.

my takeaways:

\- my symptoms never matched exactly with anyone else and i tried to read as many as possible. best i can tell its a mixed bag and you get none, some or all. i never had diarrhea, fever or chills and because so many others had, i figured i didnt have it at first.

\- losing smell & taste was the strangest part. its never happened and the first articles i read said it was an early symptom. after reading many accounts of 'anosmia' (loss of smell) on this sub-reddit and others, it feels like a later stage symptom. i am day 5 of no taste and hoping it comes back soon

\- its been really mild which i am thankful for, but also nervous about how easily it can be spread to those that are more susceptible. stay home.

edit: sorry i have not been able to respond to everyones questions. thank you for all the kind words. just wanted to add that trying to determine if you have it based on my symptoms will never lead anywhere. there just isn't anyway to be certain without a test. if you are showing any symptoms, act like you have it, theres a good chance you do and a statistically it it will be mild. others will not be so lucky so staying in will protect them. if things get bad, call 911.

ftzfc4,2020-04-02 21:57:00 UTC,"iâ€™m pretty much back to normal! my chest still feels slightly tight. i still canâ€™t get up to exercise very intensely. i feel like itâ€™s affected my blood pressure (spontaneous orthostatic hypotension, losing hearing momentarily in either ear, near fainting with excessive heat; eg: bath/hot shower). otherwise, i feel pretty much like myself again. i would say iâ€™m back to 75%/80% lung capacity compared to before, but i do get winded easily still. still sleeping quite a bit more than usual, but, who knows if thatâ€™s due to the virus alone or a combo of stress/boredom and the virus. 

my partner hasnâ€™t had very severe symptoms. the coughs are mild and the fever/chills/sweats are unpleasant but tolerable. heâ€™s lost all sense of taste and appetite. he has taken to drinking bone broth and smoothies just to keep up some stomach content. itâ€™s not looking grim, which is very good news. hoping that his upswing in recovery is better than mine! this makes day 10/11 for him, we arenâ€™t exactly sure because the sore throat seemed to present very slowly before any coughing actually happened. conservatively saying day 10 and he would be in that most critical window.. but, itâ€™s almost just like a minor cold for him. weâ€™ll take it! he has not been tested. using resources for a person known to be in direct contact with someone already infected (myself) just didnâ€™t seem to make sense unless it was necessary to hospitalize. our family doctor agreed.

fu1qi1,2020-04-03 00:31:00 UTC,"told by work the exposure likely happened 3/23. don't know who, hipaa and all, whatever.

had a light cough for a few weeks before that, i get bronchitis in the spring sometimes.

had a weird tickle in my throat last thursday. it went away by later that day. told by work to leave just in case. later called by my work and was told about a possible exposure then the a couple days later called back and told the person i had contact with tested positive. felt some light nausea here and there, faint. had a weird feeling like ""inhaled water from a pond while swimming"", that weird sharp distinct pain in my nose. it wasn't extreme and faded quickly. 

29th into 30th, profound loss of taste. i can't taste anything whatsoever. still light cough.

at this point i called and got a test scheduled for the next day, 3/31.

no taste, some exhaustion here and there for the next day or two.

call this morning saying it's positive, self isolate, etc..


what i'm scared of is the main and extreme symptom being smell and taste, i read that if it gets into the olfactory bulb it goes to the brain and the lack of ability to breathe comes from that going bad, not blocked airwaves. rare, seeing as it's a somewhat common symptom now, but it scares me as it's the big symptom right now. i've had some light stomach issues too, but nothing severe. 

before i knew there was an issue and after the encounter with the person who tested positive, and yes i'd washed by hands, but i'd had a stuffed nostral and out of just habit i'd pinched my nose but only pressed hard on once side and blew it into a tissue (stupid, i know, but that's how i am able to get a very stuffed nose clear). i saw some blood. it's likely if it was still on my finger as i pinched that it got into my nostral and there is a bleeding spot there. close to brain, close to olfactory bulb, etc...

that's what scares me.

this would be something like day 8 since i noticed something odd, only day 3 since serious symptoms (smell and taste absolutely gone), and day 10 since i was likely exposed.

fu6hzd,2020-04-03 07:08:00 UTC,"iâ€™ve been working directly with covid positive patients for the past three weeks or so. 

five days ago, my brother (21m), who lives in the same house as me, woke up with a high fever and the exact dry, grating cough that iâ€™d been hearing at work. he also had:

- sinus issues: blocked â€œstuffyâ€ nose, sore ears, hearing loss, and loss of taste and smell. 
- a mild headache and mild photophobia
- extreme fatigue (he slept most of the day)
- nausea and diarrhoea
- mood swings and irritability (a common sign of viral infection)
- very mild shortness of breath

at this point i had no symptoms whatsoever, but i phoned work to inform them that i would be self isolating as per our current policy (if we or anyone we live with develops covid symptoms weâ€™re to stay indoors for two weeks).

i had zero symptoms most of the following day either. but that night, i woke up at about 2am completely drenched in sweat, disorientated, with a racing heart and a pounding headache. checked my temperature and it was 39.7 degrees c (about 103.5 f). 

i managed to crawl out of bed and downstairs to the kitchen to get some acetaminophen (what you call tylenol in the states). couldnâ€™t face climbing back up the stairs, so i collapsed on the couch and slept there the rest of the night. 

stayed on the couch most of the following day, mostly drifting in and out of sleep and occasionally crawling out to the bathroom in the hallway. my condition has been fluctuating between this (too wiped out to do anything, pretty much as bad as itâ€™s been for me so far) and â€œrelatively okâ€ (able to do light chores, cook food, etc with minor difficulty) on and off ever since.

got swabbed a couple of days ago, swab came back positive for covid-19 (i can safely assume my brother has it too since weâ€™ve been living in the same house and his symptoms are virtually identical to mine).

impressions so far: 

- in my short time working as an rn, iâ€™ve had h1n1 (aka swine flu), norovirus, and a couple of standard seasonal influenza a strains. picking up all sorts of gnarly bugs is one of the hazards of working in the medical field. but never before this, have i had my ass kicked so hard by a virus.

- so far, for me, covid feels like a very bad flu, with bits and pieces of other viral infections thrown in... the sinus issues of the common cold (minus nasal drip and sneezing), and the gastrointestinal problems of norovirus.

- at work, iâ€™ve been wearing full ppe and i have been as diligent as possible with my donning and doffing... and i still managed to catch it. which shows you just how infectious this bastard virus is (though i could have caught it from somewhere outside of the hospital of course).

- this is hitting me and my brother like a freight train. and weâ€™re relatively fit, healthy 20-somethings. i canâ€™t imagine how rough it must be for anyone older or with comorbidities.

- not pleasant, please keep me and my brother in your thoughts.

- stay safe everyone.",$$$but$$$racing heart$$$gastrointestinal$$$smell$$$nose$$$sleep$$$sinus$$$headache$$$breath$$$temperature$$$sinus$$$nasal$$$self$$$fever$$$came$$$diarrhoea$$$pounding headache$$$headache$$$taste$$$but$$$catch$$$cough$$$slept$$$irritability$$$slept$$$sweat$$$fatigue$$$before$$$but$$$ears$$$nausea$$$degrees$$$sneezing$$$,$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Anosmia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Headache$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Headache$$$Headache$$$Ageusia$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Cough$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Irritability$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Fatigue$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Nausea$$$Pyrexia$$$Sneezing$$$,$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0011991$$$C0003126$$$C1260880$$$C0917801$$$C0948596$$$C0018681$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0948596$$$C1260880$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0011991$$$C0018681$$$C0018681$$$C2364111$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0010200$$$C0917801$$$C0022107$$$C0917801$$$C0020458$$$C0015672$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0027497$$$C0015967$$$C0037383$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

fujjin,2020-04-03 20:03:00 UTC,"today i got my results of my swab, positive.  as someone in healthcare, on the front lines, i knew it was inevitable that i would get covid-19 so it is what it is...

timeline of symptoms-

about 3 weeks ago, i started getting these headaches behind my eyes, and sensitive to light. i am accoustumed to migraines and these were not those. they were dull, achy pains that did not go away despite whatever i took or did. i busted through my special migraine meds allotted for the month in maybe a week.  

about 2 weeks ago, got a yeast infection that i couldnâ€™t get to go away. 3 rounds of diflucan po and otc, coupled with a lot of lower back pain. i chalked it up to stress and just dealt with it.

last sunday, the 29th, i went to work and started my shift just feeling tired and with back pain: this was nothing new, i have a toddler who doesnâ€™t sleep and back always hurts. as the day wore on my legs ached, my joints were extremely painful and i felt super shitty when i got home. my husband also said he was achy and had a low grade temp sat night into sunday.  by sunday evening i called out of work for monday, had a 99.6 and had a tickle in the back of my throat staring and a dry intermittent cough. 

monday 3/30: felt like i got hit by a truck. excruciating pain in my joints. so lethargic and uncomfortable. chills. sinus pressure/eye pain/headache. zero appetite. nausea. sensitivity to noise. thought it was flu? i had a flu outbreak in my facility...twice..and had one positive flu a and a whole unit on tamiflu. called my doctor, wanted a flu swab, they said no and told me to monitor myself. no covid testing because i didnâ€™t have a temp over 100.5 or have breathing problems. the whole day i barely moved. just sitting upright for 5 minutes did me in. drank gatorade, threw up. no sense of smell or taste. 

tuesday 3/31: felt even worse than monday. decided to see if urgent care would assess me due to my symptoms and being a healthcare worker. went right there, they swabbed me and said theyâ€™d call me.  nausea, low grade temps, some vomiting, no smell or taste, fatigue, chills. my whole body was causing me severe pain. terrible neck pain. couldnâ€™t even walk down the steps without wanting to cry from pain.
 
wednesday 4/1: barely made it out of bed, and only to use bathroom. that winded me from going 25 feet i just laid back down in bed. no smell, no taste, no appetite, no po intake besides like applesauce. felt miserable. low grade temps. cough and sore throat gone

thursday 4/2:  much like 4/1. pained me to sit up.  having anxiety.  didnâ€™t eat anything, barely drank. 

today 4/3: slightly more energy. didnâ€™t immediately need to lay back down after opening my eyes. having anxiety still. no taste or smell still, but able to eat some stuff and drink more.  went outside for about an hour and the air felt good. 

predominately for me my sx so far have been extreme body aches, joint pain, back pain, neck pain, loss of smell/taste, no appetite, headache, low grade temps on tylenol atc. my sp02 has been 95-96, usually itâ€™s 100. my respirationâ€™s overall are slightly higher than my normal. used my albuterol inhaler twice. no respiratory component so i am lucky with that.

fuz4x5,2020-04-04 14:55:00 UTC,"sharing the timeline  of my symptoms - if it helps.

i am a healthy 38/m - not overweight, moderately active(walk 15 miles and run 7 miles a week) and with no underlying health issues.

day 1 - mild throat irritation.  no soreness or pain.

day 2 - low grade fever 99f until evening.  fever was 101 late evening and whole body ached. took ibuprofen at night.

day 3 - bad body ache and malaise.   felt could not stand on my feet due to weakness and  lightheadedness.  lost sense of smell and taste for next 3 days. fever 102. took 3 doses of ibuprofen through the day. pain behind the eye for next 3 days. had severe bloating and belching.  had confusion and slight dizziness.

day 4 - woke up - went to the restroom - came out - had a blackout and crashed on the floor.  never experienced this ever before in my life.  went to my doctor where my temp was recorded 100.  by evening fever was gone.  was feeling much better.  only stomach was making severe rumbling and churning noise continuously.  bloating and belching continued.

day 5 - symptoms same as day 4.  started on probiotic - culturelle - and antacid - pantoprozaole on instr from by doctor.  had an episode of diarrhea.

day 6 - 8 - mild sob.  felt out of breath talking over the phone.  had mild abdominal cramps, bloating and belching and stools were soft and not normal.

day 9 - went to er since sob worsened relatively. shallow breathing was ok but could not breathe deep.  felt like room was out of air.   chest xray ct scan came normal - o2 was normal. gi symptoms continued but forgot to mention to er.  sent back home.

day 10 - 12 sob and gi remained the same.  my gp told me my sob could be because of the acidity and bloating.

day 13 - went to er for sob again.  xray came normal.  ekg was normal.   learnt a coworker tested positive a day earlier.  er took a swab since i had possible exposure.  was told the swab might get rejected given by age and relatively mild symptoms.  sent back home and asked to talk to gp for my gi symptoms.

day 15 - felt better for the first time like some of my body strength came back.  started work from home.  mild sob.  gi symptoms continued but with constipation.

day 16 - 20   gi symptoms remained the same. mild sob.  had chills out of nowhere in the evenings and nights.  felt very cold even though the weather was not as much.  had swollen and sore lymph nodes on chest and arm. felt like i had irregular hb/tachycardia at nights. abdominal cramps got worse on day 18 and 19.  had mild dizziness on and off. had difficulty sleeping - kept waking up for no reason.

day 21 -23 kept getting progressively better.

day 24 - felt much better.  hb/tachycardia gone.  late in the evening got call from er doctor confirming positive test.  

day 25 - 26 - no weakness or malaise.  sob gone.  no abdominal cramps and pains.  just constipated and a little acidity.  lymph node soreness/pain subsided.  hoping no new symptoms come up.  will talk to my doctor about when i can resume my running and cycling - curious to know how my body holds up.


edit: lost 3 kgs in the first 2 weeks.  now gained half of it back.  appetite came back around day 14.

also had back ache and tingling in week 3.  could be because of wfh and my bad chair.",$$$eye$$$soreness$$$sob$$$but$$$but$$$breath$$$sob$$$stomach$$$abdominal$$$weakness$$$cramps$$$chills$$$sob$$$sob$$$belching$$$appetite$$$belching$$$gi$$$belching$$$shallow breathing$$$came$$$but$$$stand$$$cramps$$$talking$$$tachycardia$$$confusion$$$nodes$$$dizziness$$$abdominal$$$soreness$$$came$$$arm$$$came$$$tachycardia$$$abdominal$$$tachycardia$$$dizziness$$$grade fever$$$diarrhea$$$fever$$$before$$$sense$$$cramps$$$low grade fever$$$fever$$$gi$$$came$$$gi$$$whole$$$sob$$$sob$$$sob$$$tachycardia$$$sleeping$$$came$$$breathe$$$tachycardia$$$fever$$$lightheadedness$$$temp$$$throat$$$fever$$$gi$$$taste$$$sob$$$weakness$$$tachycardia$$$smell$$$breathing$$$gi$$$,$$$Eye pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Abdominal pain$$$Fatigue$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Chills$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Loss of appetite$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Dyspnea$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Palpitations$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Lymphadenopathy$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Abdominal pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Cough$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Cough$$$Palpitations$$$Abdominal pain$$$Palpitations$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Anosmia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Cough$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$Palpitations$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Palpitations$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Ageusia$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Palpitations$$$Anosmia$$$Dyspnea$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$,$$$C0151827$$$C0741585$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0011991$$$C0000737$$$C0015672$$$C0741585$$$C0085593$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0011991$$$C0232462$$$C0011991$$$C0011991$$$C0011991$$$C0013404$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C0741585$$$C2363731$$$C0030252$$$C0012833$$$C0497156$$$C0012833$$$C0000737$$$C0741585$$$C0010200$$$C0741585$$$C0010200$$$C0030252$$$C0000737$$$C0030252$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0003126$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0010200$$$C0011991$$$C0741585$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0030252$$$C0917801$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0030252$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C2364111$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0030252$$$C0003126$$$C0013404$$$C0011991$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

iâ€™m worried. i know the crash tends to happen around a week to two weeks, so i should be past that point. i felt like i was on the mend, and now iâ€™m back to feeling sick.

fvb57e,2020-04-05 05:29:00 UTC,"i don't know how to link my previous post, but i made a post last week when i found out i was positive for covid 19.  since a few people have followed me and ask about the progression i wanted to give an update.

day 20 - got the test in the morning,  was having trouble breathing so went to the er.  er gave prednisone for 4 days and albuterol inhaler as well as nausea medication 

day 21 - breathing problems even worse than before, even with prednisone and inhaler.  can't even leave the bed without getting winded.  can't have conversations or speak full sentences without getting winded.   sleep constantly. temperature just over 100. sweating and upper back pain is constant.  using inhaler every couple of hours.

day 22 - breathing is -a hair- better.  now  feelings of dread and imminent death are constant.  temperature still in the low 100's. trouble sleeping but i think it's from the prednisone. 

day 23 - breathing just a hair better still. using inhaler every few hours. still very winded from walking to the bathroom or having a conversation.  feels almost like i lost my voice. borderline hysterical from stress. high heart rates, still sweating. 

day 24 - have finished prednisone. breathing is better.  using inhaler less. still sleeping and not leaving bed.  just reading books all day every day.  feelings of stress and dread have decreased.  temperature still low 100's.
my stool turned completely solid, like stone, i'm assuming from the anti nausea and anti diarrhea medicine. it's like shitting cement baseballs.  it's so hard and big that i was actually bleeding, every bowel movement leaves me in tears, which is exacerbated by the hysteria i'm already feeling.

day 25 - breathing continues to improve. only using inhaler a few times a day. sleep has improved,  i'm assuming because i've finished the prednisone.  stool is still difficult to pass but seems to be improving slowly.

day 26 - breathing is way better.  feelings of dread and stress mostly gone.  stomach hurts a lot, am pooping a lot after being backed up and then constipated. now when i wake up my entire body aches.  my face, hands,  legs, arms, breasts, armpits,  etc hurts to the touch. everything feels like one giant bruise. very interesting and unusual,  never felt anything like it. almost like whole body whiplash from a car crash.

day 27 - body aches just a touch improved but still very much there.  did not use inhaler for the entire day. able to have conversations and walk around without exhausting my voice or breath.  spent a few hours cleaning and taking care of the house which i haven't done in a few weeks.  almost no dread, very low stress.  temperature now mid 99's.

day 28 (today) - i haven't been to sleep yet but i feel pretty good.  haven't used the inhaler since friday (it's now sunday).  starting to consider going back to work. 

in all this my appetite has been extremely healthy.  i've gotten nausea and dry heaving and stomach cramps but overall i have not missed a meal and have had periods of being extremely hungry.  i weighed myself today and while my clothes still fit i have gained 7-8 pounds in the past 2 weeks since iast weighed myself; i am sure some of it was due to the prednisone water retention and constipation. 

my advice for anyone who is sick or thinks they might be getting sick is to keep a diary or a log of some kind. detail what you eat, your temperature,  mood and any other symptoms.   this can act as a gauge for you to determine whether you're getting better or worse, can be a gauge for your doctor, can help you identify things that make you feel better or worse (diet or whatnot) and can even possibly help you get tested if it comes to that.

the feelings of dread and hysteria are normal i think. don't let it get the best of you. it will pass.

if you have a close friend, make sure they know you are sick so they can check up on you if they haven't heard from you in a day or two.

finally,  call your doctor if you think you are sick. many doctors are doing video visits.  

if you cannot breathe or are struggling to breathe, call 911 or go to the nearest er!! you should err on the side of caution,  especially when it comes to breathing problems.  don't doubt yourself or wonder if you are overreacting - if you are struggling to breathe, you need immediate medical attention.

edits to add:
day 22 is when i received the test results.

am due for my menstrual cycle today, which is usually preceded a day or two by light spotting. no sign of cycle anywhere in sight, but i have somewhat regularly been inexplicably late by a week or more in the past so this could just be normal for me.

smell and taste have slowwwwwly been returning. i can't quite taste distinct flavors but i can taste sweet, bitter, salty, etc.  i lost my smell and taste about 13 days ago, started getting it back 3-4 days ago (days 16 and 24 in, respectively)",$$$sweating$$$sweating$$$breathe$$$sleep$$$arms$$$stress$$$stress$$$taste$$$sleep$$$nausea$$$temperature$$$breathe$$$diarrhea$$$voice$$$pass$$$nausea$$$breathing$$$breathing$$$legs$$$breathing$$$pass$$$sleep$$$hungry$$$nausea$$$stress$$$appetite$$$eat$$$before$$$mid$$$breathing$$$voice$$$stress$$$temperature$$$but$$$breathe$$$temperature$$$but$$$taste sweet$$$but$$$but$$$reading$$$but$$$temperature$$$taste$$$but$$$but$$$breathing$$$exhausting$$$smell$$$shitting$$$breathing$$$breathing$$$temperature$$$but$$$stomach$$$breath$$$weeks since$$$taste$$$cramps$$$pounds$$$sleeping$$$breathing$$$stomach$$$smell$$$whole$$$sleeping$$$taste$$$,"$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Dyspnea$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Ageusia$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Nausea$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Nausea$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Loss of appetite$$$Nausea$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Loss of appetite$$$Loss of appetite$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Ageusia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Ageusia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Anosmia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Dyspnea$$$Myalgia$$$Ageusia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$other$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Dyspnea$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Anosmia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Ageusia$$$",$$$C0020458$$$C0020458$$$C0013404$$$C0917801$$$C0741585$$$C1832070$$$C1832070$$$C2364111$$$C0917801$$$C0027497$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0011991$$$C2363731$$$C0012833$$$C0027497$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0741585$$$C0013404$$$C0012833$$$C0917801$$$C0232462$$$C0027497$$$C1832070$$$C0232462$$$C0232462$$$C0013456$$$C0741585$$$C0013404$$$C2363731$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C2364111$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C2364111$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0003126$$$C0011991$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0013404$$$C0231528$$$C2364111$$$C0741585$$$C0000000$$$C0917801$$$C0013404$$$C0011991$$$C0003126$$$C0741585$$$C0917801$$$C2364111$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

fvlnq8,2020-04-05 17:21:00 UTC,"to start off, iâ€™m a 20 years old male uni student. i have a medical history of asthma which had somehow died down around 12 years ago. other than that, im extremely healthy and active. 

first symptom:  night of march 26th. dyspnea, no fever, no chills, taste buds all good. 

possible infection sources? 
-either food delivery, or the supermarket. schools are closed, but here in my country, life goes on, in additions to rules banning public gathering but no curfews are enforced. iâ€™m guessing, its due to contaminated food or probably got infected by the airborne pathogen in the supermarket. 

did i perform preventative measures? 
-heck yes. i always wore a face mask which i never took off till i got back home and disposed after one use. also washed my hand with hand sanitizer so often, that the upper skin layer of my hand were kinda shedding. 
in my case: mask and hand sanitizer did not work.

tested positive: 30th of march. 

now, why did it takes me 3 days to go for a test? you see, on the 26th, i ate some really high sodium food, i felt bloated afterward. then 4 hours later, i started experiencing dyspnea. i had corona infection on my thoughts but dismissed it after googling. its simply a case of self diagnosis gone wrong. googling led me to believe that my dyspnea was caused by the high salt consumption 4 hours prior, and that the quickest way to flush the salt out, was to exercise. i was wrong, exercising made it worst.

but fortunately, the dyspnea was very bearable. i heard stories about how severe it was for other patients that i simply dismissed the possibility of me, being infected. where in my case, it was just like, holding a heavy pillow on your chest.

3 days later, it did not go away, i could no longer believe that it was a simple salt-overconsumption problem. i went for a test on the 29th, informed that iâ€™m positive on the 30th.

at first, the doctors were gonna have me hospitalized, but after a new wave of elderly patients came in and they need the hospital beds. after doing some tests on me, they said i have pneumonia. the good thing was, my history of asthma did not relapse. 

the doc, decided that iâ€™m healthy enough to fight it off at home. they gave me medicines for common colds, anti inflammatory drugs and a few tablets of paracetamol (lol!) and i was transport back to self isolate at home. 

my family were moved out, local authorities informed to keep tabs on me. also i were to receive regular check up once, every 2 days. 

life goes on in self isolation. netflix, taking my meds, eating delivered meals, laundry, cleaning, games, exercising, having a few guys in hazmat suits came to take my nasal swabs. repeat. 

i noticed that my sleep hours became longer, after showing symptoms: i slept for over 11 hours a day!

on the 2nd of april, my dyspnea peaked. i remember waking up, laying in bed for an hour, manually breathing, exerting my whole concentration and energy on inhales and exhales. i felt like i would suffocate if i dont focus on breathing in and out. but then, it got better. the dyspnea became mild again. in fact, it goes away nearly completely, it comes back from times to times but i could barely notice any difficulty breathing now.

however, after dyspnea started disappearing, my taste buds went off. especially my salt receptors. beef tastes like rubber, everything tastes like rubber. except for some sour and spicy food. my tongue feels like sand paper. i also started experiencing mild fever and night sweats. but no cough at all, aside from an occasional burning feelings at the back of my throat.

im currently on my 10th day, still in home isolation, under strict monitoring. but daily exercise and eating normally is bringing me back to health. the meds they gave me was just to treat symptomatic conditions. if it goes well, iâ€™ll be free in a week.

as iâ€™m writing this in the middle of the night, iâ€™m having a cold sweat right now, my chest feels a bit heavy but i know iâ€™m getting better.

i told my doctors about my experience, they said iâ€™m one of the lucky ones. my condition is the most mildest case amongst other covid-19 patients. that dyspnea peak i had 4 days ago, could be fatal for other patients, occasionally requiring immediate lungs intubation. 

so yeah, that was my experience as one of the healthier patient of covid-19. eat well, sleep well and in case you got infected, i hope youâ€™re having it easy like me. 

feel free to ask any questions, i have absolutely nothing to do here. i could go into more details on any parts you have questions for.

the sad news. my uncle who was confirmed positive right at one month ago who required hospitalization but not vent or life support had seemed to make a full recovery. this morning at 3am his gf called 911 as he fell to the ground unable to talk. no history of high blood pressure or stroke in family. scans showed catastrophic stroke and he has been declared brain dead. speaking with physicians it appears this is not the first case of covid pt with thrombotic issue and they believe it is correlated. he is in a different state than my entire family, our state and his with stay at home orders. unclear at this time how to handle a funeral or his estate or anything with that in place. he also wanted to be an organ donor but looking at unos website appears they may be declining covid positive organs. idk where or what to do.

i live in zuid-holland province in the netherlands and tested positive, sorry if i go all over the place writing this, my brain is really foggy.

iâ€™m turning 15 this month and tested positive, iâ€™m on day 4 of symptoms (was lucky to get tested, theres a huge shortage of tests here currently, espevially in my area) and my current symptoms include:

-bad nausea (only after eating)
-discomfort in stomach
-discomfort in guts
-life feels like iâ€™m dreaming (that feeling you have with a fever)
-tightness on chest / pressure on chest / slight shortness of breath
-heat flashes
-no energy

my symptoms imo are pretty severe from someone whos my age and healthy (it could be a lot worse though so iâ€™m thankful) but iâ€™m hoping for the best. my doctor told me i was allowed to stay home, get rest and keep eating / drinking / sleeping.

we also have a little thing that clips onto your finger (i forgot what itâ€™s called) that measures bpm and saturation, my doctor said if my breathing starts to get even more difficult and my saturation drops iâ€™ll need to go to a hospital which is pretty scary to me.

fwvizn,2020-04-07 19:47:00 UTC,"healthy 22f, no medical conditions, don't smoke, normal bmi. ab+ blood type. 

possible point of infection- i'm in close contact with a person who says they feel almost better from being ""a bit sniffly"". two days later, symptoms begin. edit: this person tested negative later.

day 1: i wake up with post nasal drip and a mild sore throat. the sick person texts me saying they've gotten sicker instead of better, with now a headache and feeling unusually warm.

day 2: sore throat disappears, now i just have the post nasal drip. i sneeze on rare occasion.

day 3: post nasal drip fades in the morning. i feel better, almost 100%. i tell myself that this definitely isn't coronavirus. as i'm lying in bed i feel the post nasal drip come back, but i figure it's just because i'm lying down. 

day 4: nope, the post nasal drip and sore throat have returned, with now the added symptoms of fatigue and a mild headache. sneezing has slightly worsened. halfway through my shift at work, which was deemed essential, i start to feel flu-like symptoms. i feel feverish. i alternate between feeling too hot and too cold. my limbs ache and i feel weak. i'm exhausted. i start to feel extremely faint while standing, hop on google and realize i likely have dehydrated myself. i down some water and force some lunch down my throat. my appetite has disappeared. i've read online that ibuprofen can worsen coronavirus but it's all i have, and i'm desperate to get through work and to the weekend. the combination of water, food, and ibuprofen helps immensely. now i just have the post nasal drip and fatigue. the ibuprofen wears off at night and i start feeling warm and achy, but its mild. the battery in my thermometer is dead, so i have no clue what my temperature is. i have strange, feverish dreams.

day 5: i wake up to feeling the same as i did at the very start of day 4. but i'm probably running what i assume is a mild fever. my gut twinges on rare occasion and i'm not hungry. rather than take more ibuprofen, i'll just ride it out. i sneeze for the last time at about noon. it's 2 am and my fever has spiked, i'm huddled under three heavy blankets and still cold. my arms in particular ache. i can't figure out whether my breathing is shallow or not, and if it is if it's just from anxiety about the possibility of coronavirus. a fingertip pulse oximeter that tells me my oxygen saturation is ranging from 96-99, which is lower than my typical of 99-100 but not concerning. taking very deep breaths occasionally gives a mild sharp pain in my lower chest, but its so faint i can't even tell if i'm imagining it or not. i'm on this subreddit trying to figure out if i have coronavirus and taking online quizzes about getting tested where i can't answer properly if i have a temperature. it's not recommended for me to seek a test apparently. i fall asleep and wake up to kick off the blankets at 4 am, my fever has broken. i'm desperately thirsty and drag an entire package of water bottles over to my bed to drink through the night.

day 6: i wake up feeling a lot better. now, i only have a headache and a general sense of being sick (a little tired, a little weak). the area right under my jaw hurts. i hope it's my lymph nodes/immune system finally figuring themselves out, but i have no idea. i go to make an omelette and am cutting the onion when i realize i don't smell anything. i give it a good whiff, practically snorting the thing, and manage to get some scent off of it. i walk around my house sniffing random objects and guesstimate about 90% of my sense of smell is gone. the omelette tastes like nothing but salt. i have my first and only case of diarrhea.

days 7-8: the jaw pain disappears, followed quickly by the headache, and then slowly my sense of taste and smell returns.

days 9-14: no symptoms at all. 

day 15: my state has relaxed restrictions for coronavirus testing as of yesterday, there's now a drive-thru test site. i live with a family member who works in the er and now feels sick, but is a notorious hypochondriac. the family member schedules a test for both of us online, even though i figure after a week of no symptoms that even if i did have coronavirus, that i would no longer test positive. the phone call comes, she's negative but i'm positive. i'm absolutely blown back. 

honestly, i thought this virus would be way worse than this. i had only about two days where i felt really sick. probably didn't even make it into my top 5 worse cases of illness. i experienced many symptoms, but none were that severe. i never developed a cough, never struggled to breathe. wouldn't have thought anything of it normally. feel free to ask me any questions.

edit: possible point of infection person tested negative, so at this point the only people left that i had interaction with was my coworkers. 
my state's department of health contacted me and i am under quarantine until april 14th (7 days after testing), close family member that i live with is under quarantine until april 28th.",$$$jaw$$$sneezing$$$thought$$$diarrhea$$$throat$$$sneeze$$$fever$$$jaw$$$throat$$$arms$$$nasal$$$fever$$$breathing$$$headache$$$but$$$thirsty$$$warm$$$sneeze$$$anxiety$$$smell$$$fatigue$$$thought$$$nasal$$$state$$$dehydrated$$$headache$$$nodes$$$sharp$$$feverish$$$nasal$$$nasal$$$fatigue$$$smell$$$headache$$$appetite$$$but$$$but$$$warm$$$smell$$$feverish$$$but$$$temperature$$$tired$$$sense$$$headache$$$nasal$$$sense$$$hungry$$$weak$$$fever$$$throat$$$throat$$$temperature$$$but$$$weak$$$nasal$$$but$$$taste$$$but$$$cough$$$but$$$achy$$$but$$$but$$$breathe$$$sense$$$but$$$,"$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Sneezing$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Sneezing$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Dehydration$$$Hot Flush$$$Sneezing$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Anosmia$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Dehydration$$$Headache$$$Lymphadenopathy$$$Chest pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Fatigue$$$Anosmia$$$Headache$$$Loss of appetite$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Hot Flush$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Anosmia$$$Headache$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Anosmia$$$Loss of appetite$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Pyrexia$$$Ageusia$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$",$$$C0741585$$$C0037383$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C2363731$$$C0037383$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C2363731$$$C0741585$$$C1260880$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0011175$$$C0600142$$$C0037383$$$C1832070$$$C0003126$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C1260880$$$C0012833$$$C0011175$$$C0018681$$$C0497156$$$C0008031$$$C0015967$$$C1260880$$$C1260880$$$C0015672$$$C0003126$$$C0018681$$$C0232462$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0600142$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0003126$$$C0018681$$$C1260880$$$C0003126$$$C0232462$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C1260880$$$C0015967$$$C2364111$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
fwyoua,2020-04-07 23:13:00 UTC,"while cov2 doesn't have any official treatments yet, i figure it doesn't hurt to talk about managing symptoms to make the experience as comfortable as possible. i know many people have their own experience, so please add to this and share what worked for you. this is not medical advice.

1. managing o2/co2 - whether the mechanism that prohibits efficient respiration occurs in the lungs or directly on red blood cells, having too much co2 and not enough o2 leads to nasty symptoms. hypercapnia, or excessive co2 in the blood, can cause severe dizziness, headaches, delirium, muscle spasms, arrhythmia, hr spikes, and other things you don't want. therefore, conserve your movements if you're having a blood attack! if you can feel your face and hands going numb when you get a glass of water, you should be resting between movements. do not push yourself here.

2. managing hypertension - as the cov2 spike protein attacks your ace2 receptors, it signals your body to increase blood pressure. this is also an uncomfortable feeling. if your hands and feet feel swollen, or you can see your veins popping out, that's why. avoid excessive salt consumption throughout this journey. maybe you can also eat nitric oxide rich foods and potassium rich foods. there are a number of herbs and over the counters which also help lower blood pressure. i'm not a doctor so i won't tell you how to do this, but the hypertension definitely makes things feel worse. i will also say, the mechanism your body uses to increase blood pressure causes you to excrete your potassium faster than otherwise. take a vitamin, eat some kiwis or plums.

3. managing doom and gloom - the hardest part about this is feeling like it's endless and you're powerless. maybe even alone. you can break this cycle! it does wonders talking or video chatting with friends and family. it's hard to think straight when there's so much funk in your head, so i would say healthy distractions are key after getting oxygen and nutrition figured out. anxiety only heightens the other symptoms, so find something that calms you.

4. chills/weak blood/shakes - the best thing that worked for me here was hot baths. i know this isn't always viable, but it seemed to help get me back to normal temperatures for awhile.

5. gi issues - a probiotic and garlic helped me. maybe there's other suggestions out there?

6. find your placebo - i took excessive amounts of garlic and i'm still not sure that it didn't actually help me. its antiviral, right? but i believed it was helping and that gave me something at least to make me feel better. i know this is kind of hand wavey, but thinking something is helping you definitely helps.

i don't have a good suggestion for any of the following, so feel free to expand with what worked for you: shortness of breath, lung pain, headaches, dizziness, congestion, nasal swelling, runny nose, body stiffness, random body pains, night sweats, insomnia, fatigue, cough, fever",$$$head$$$but$$$something$$$muscle spasms$$$something$$$muscle spasms$$$fever$$$weak$$$but$$$hr$$$hypertension$$$alone$$$sweats$$$delirium$$$eat$$$hypertension$$$dizziness$$$night sweats$$$talking$$$nose$$$nasal$$$dizziness$$$but$$$but$$$gi$$$something$$$shakes$$$runny nose$$$cough$$$eat$$$glass$$$headaches$$$muscle$$$headaches$$$anxiety$$$numb$$$breath$$$temperatures$$$fatigue$$$chills$$$,"$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Myalgia$$$Chest tightness$$$Myalgia$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Hypertension$$$Fatigue$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Loss of appetite$$$Hypertension$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Chest tightness$$$Chills$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Cough$$$Loss of appetite$$$Dyspnea$$$Headache$$$Myalgia$$$Headache$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Chills$$$",$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C0231528$$$C0235710$$$C0231528$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0020538$$$C0015672$$$C0020458$$$C0012833$$$C0232462$$$C0020538$$$C0012833$$$C0020458$$$C2363731$$$C1260880$$$C1260880$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0235710$$$C0085593$$$C1260880$$$C0010200$$$C0232462$$$C0013404$$$C0018681$$$C0231528$$$C0018681$$$C1832070$$$C0741585$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0085593$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
fx1xom,2020-04-08 03:22:00 UTC,"hello all,

yes i am still alive!  that has been the biggest question ive been recieving in my inbox.  i was trying not to look on reddit much because reading this subreddit gives me extreme anxiety.   so around day 12 i still was not getting better and was still having shortness of breath.  i did one of those virtual dr visits and the dr told me i sound fine and prescribed me an inhaler.  talked to a few people and they told me to get a chest xray.  well i had pneumonia in my left lung.  prescribed me a zpak/cefdinir.  i then had a fever day 16 and i was extremely frustrated.  i finally  started feeling some energy around day 19.  on day 26 i am feeling better but still feeling tightness in my chest.  i have yet to find a pulmonologist willing to take me because i tested positive for covid.  i do not have my sense of smell back yet.  

i still have a lot of anxiety because i am very active and i do not want this to affect me long term.  i know this is not as organized as my last post but i wanted to give everyone an update.  i know at least 50 people who tested positive.  a lot of older 40+ had fevers for up to 10+ days.  and i know at least 5 people under 35 who have the same prognosis as me pneumonia in the lower left lung.  for all the myths i am o+ and this virus crushed me.  i have zero underlying illnesses 27 years old..  i've been sick before but jesus christ this virus owns me.  i will be the first person in line to recieve the vaccine. 

 if you have any questions or just need to talk to help with anxiety over the fears of covid i will do my best to answer them all since i have a lot of time on my hands.  for all of you going through it right now just focus on how you feel now and try not to worry about whats to come tomorrow.  take care of yourself and continue to follow the social distancing.  godspeed",$$$before$$$fevers$$$pneumonia$$$focus$$$smell$$$anxiety$$$anxiety$$$pneumonia$$$fever$$$worry$$$frustrated$$$anxiety$$$but$$$but$$$sense$$$energy$$$but$$$reading$$$tightness$$$look$$$breath$$$,"$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$other$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Anosmia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$other$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Irritability$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Chest tightness$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Dyspnea$$$",$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0000000$$$C0012833$$$C0003126$$$C1832070$$$C1832070$$$C0000000$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0022107$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0235710$$$C0741585$$$C0013404$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

hey all, so i just wanted to share my experience with this very weird virus so far: 

day 1: started to get post nasal drip and a cough, though, a productive cough. 

day 2: same as day 1, but began to feel a little lethargic at work. 

day 3: same as day 2, but add a sore throat. 

day 4: sore throat worsened and became dry. there were moments i had to gasp for air because i could not stop coughing, though the cough was in my throat, not my chest. in addition, i began having gi problems (nasuea / diarrhea), which i attributed to antibiotics i was on for a skin infection. at this point, i figured i was getting my usual seasonal spring allergies mixed with a bad rxn from the antibiotics. nothing felt out of the ordinary for me at this point!!

day 5: my workplace (direct care staff) sent me to get tested because i had been coughing. when i woke up on day 5, my symptoms were identical to a sinus infection (congestion / pain around eyes and forehead, loss of smell / taste / continued mucus and productive coughing).

day 6 + 7: same as day 5.

day 8: sinus congestion completely gone, just no taste / smell. 

day 9 + 10: same as day 8.

day 11: received my results back from the test. i was positive for covid-19. i was told to remain in quarentine for another week. still no smell / taste. 

day 12: decided to go for a run in my basement and got shorted out of breath fairly quickly. not sure if it's from the covid or the fact that i've been stagnant for a week. otherwise, still can't smell / taste.

day 13: no symptoms besides still not being able to smell / taste. 

currently on day 14 and i will update as i progress through the remainder of the 5 days.

iâ€™m not a stranger to rapid heart rate because iâ€™m diagnosed with lqts and inappropriate sinus tachycardia, but iâ€™m not used to it being so consistent. 

i went to the er this morning per my doctorâ€™s request (intermittent chest pain and the tachycardia). i was outside in the ambulance bay for the entirety of my visit. my pulse was 148bpm sitting down, so they took an ekg and chest x-ray. both came back normal. pulse ox was normal too. they pretty much just told me to go home and work on my anxiety. 

so now iâ€™m sitting at home drinking pedialyte, and my heart rate is still around 140bpm. hoping even more hydration will help.

**day 7:** basically peeing from my ass. also vomiting at the same time. bit of fever and bit of bone aches that night. 

(so far, all these symptoms were bearable, just a bit of discomfort, no pain. but for 1 hour on day 7 it was awful and unbearable after i had the diarrhea. i laid in bed lightheaded almost like i was gonna black out or something. really uncomfortable.)

**day 8:** i wake up feeling amazing! bone pain a tiny bit there.

(i started googling shit around this time. aparrently covid will make your blood sugar high, hence sweet smell.)

**day 9:** panted once, after walking *down* the stairs. oh no am i imagining things? or is it getting to my respiratory system? breathing feels clean and nice.

**day 10:** panting after going down the stairs, a few times. uh oh. never happens to me. did the virus move to my respiratory system that time i vomited to hard that vomit came shooting out my nose? slight tickle in back of throat for 2 hrs in the morning. coughed a few times, cleared my throat, it soon went away. 

(will update more. will it get real bad and attack my respiratory system? or will i have generated enough antibodies during the time it was in my gut, to make the respiratory attack very mild? stay tuned for next week's update...ðÿ¤¦â€â™€ï¸)

so i have a theory as to how i got this. i was staying inside my home for 5 weeks. got this on week 5. must have ingested this via not microwaving delivery good enough. i'm thinking that ppl who breathe it in get their respiratory symptoms first, people who ingest it get their gastro symptoms first.",$$$away$$$fever$$$vomiting$$$respiratory$$$leg$$$smell$$$pounds$$$breathe$$$but$$$diarrhea$$$respiratory$$$respiratory$$$sleeping$$$gastro$$$vomited$$$throat$$$catch$$$pass$$$respiratory$$$but$$$respiratory$$$nose$$$smell$$$came$$$something$$$lightheaded$$$sense$$$breathing$$$coughed$$$bone$$$throat$$$bone$$$sweat$$$rocky poo$$$diarrhea$$$,$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Vomiting$$$Dyspnea$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Anosmia$$$other$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Vomiting$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Palpitations$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Anosmia$$$Cough$$$Chest tightness$$$Myalgia$$$Anosmia$$$Dyspnea$$$Cough$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$,$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0042963$$$C0013404$$$C0741585$$$C0003126$$$C0000000$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0917801$$$C0011991$$$C0042963$$$C2363731$$$C0030252$$$C0012833$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C1260880$$$C0003126$$$C0010200$$$C0235710$$$C0231528$$$C0003126$$$C0013404$$$C0010200$$$C0741585$$$C2363731$$$C0741585$$$C0020458$$$C0011991$$$C0011991$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
fxwt8y,2020-04-09 13:38:00 UTC,"outside of being extremely excited/relieved, i wanted to post this for anyone that is experiencing daily stress and anxiety about their loss of sense/taste.  i checked this subreddit hourly looking for other people's experiences to see if/when my asnomia would go away.  hoping this post provides some comfort for anyone else doing the same.

i lost my sense of smell on march 23rd, reached out to my doctor, got tested the next day and received a positive result.  the days prior i had some mild congestion, and woke up one night having sweated through my sheets.  took my temperature daily, but did not record a fever.  i had no other major symptoms (no fever, no shortness of breath, no coughing fits, etc.) throughout the entire duration.  i couldn't smell anything, and my taste was limited to being able to discern salty, sweet, and spicy, but not actual flavors.

this morning, i woke up and did my daily smell test (spraying cologne on a wall), and couldn't smell it.  a few hours later, i caught a whiff of my coffee and immediately retested my smell.  could smell clearly, i'd say back to 70% percent after smelling other things in my apartment.  was like someone flipped a switch in my brain.

this was a stressful/annoying time, but by no means even close to as bad as other people's experiences with covid-19.  nonetheless, for anyone else experiencing this and searching this subreddit, wanted to share my experience. hang in there and best wishes!",$$$coughing$$$but$$$away$$$smell$$$smell$$$stress$$$fever$$$fever$$$anxiety$$$sense$$$but$$$smell$$$smell$$$temperature$$$taste$$$sense$$$but$$$smell$$$taste$$$smell$$$breath$$$coughing fits$$$,"$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Anosmia$$$Anosmia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Ageusia$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Ageusia$$$Anosmia$$$Dyspnea$$$Cough$$$",$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0003126$$$C0003126$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C2364111$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C2364111$$$C0003126$$$C0013404$$$C0010200$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

fykla4,2020-04-10 13:43:00 UTC,"as the title says... i've been living with symptoms for 29 days. i've been through the pneumonia stage and now have alarming neurological issues alongside all the exsisting symptoms.

current issues:

* balance
* memory
* huge fatigue levels
* concentration
* still having a huge fever every 12 hours or so. seems  to focus in my core and head.
* sinuses feel horrible
* back and muscle pain
* ringing in my ears and pressure drops

started out mild. day 10-18 peaked with the severe trouble breathing, organ pains, heart palpitations.

i'm now concerned this virus is somewhat herpes or hiv like in that it hides out in my spine. i could feel the nerves in my spine tingle two weeks ago. anecdotal i know, but clinical studies are showing evidence of  [cns and brain infection potential.](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/lost-smell-and-taste-hint-covid-19-can-target-the-nervous-system-67312) . coincidentally we're seeing  [alarming relapse rates](https://www.ibtimes.com/coronavirus-update-51-recovered-patients-test-positive-again-virus-reactivated-2955560) in asian countries, signifying a potential period of dormancy.

herpes simplex virus lays dormant within the spine and periodically sheds as it emerges when your immune system relaxes. i understand the lack of genetic link but it's the mechanism i want to highlight.

i'm dealing with the neuro issues constantly but the attacks of fever and muscle aches are periodic, about every 12 hours, lasting hours till it subdues just as fast as it started.

i think the media has pushed a narrative of either you die or recover fully and quickly from this illness and i'm not sure it's the case given the evidence at hand.

anecdotal evidence shows a fair few western countries making it extremely hard to get tested. could this be manipulation of the figures with intent to downplay the severity of the situation for as long as possible?

why are we focusing on recoveries when all it seems to signifying is failure to die from ards or complications whilst in hospital admission? iirc hospital discharge times in the uk is now down to 3 hours. potentially pushing people through to a 'recovered' status way before an actual recovery.

i am sorry for anyone living this situation as i am. i have no intent of scaremongering, but i do wish to bring attention to the lack of public awareness.

anyone else now at 25+ days and living the same situation? please speak out and share your experience.

edit:

i'm being told it's possible other issues could be at play here rather than a repeated virus relapse. 

post viral fatigue (pvf) - this can lead onto chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs)/(me) myalgic encephalomyelitis.

27m/o+/overweight/healthcare worker/nightly pot smoker x3-4 months

i work in ems. likely some exposure as some other coworkers have tested positive.

day 1-8 - flu like symptoms. fatigue, feverish, chills, diarrhea started day 5. no appetite but nothing i couldnâ€™t work through. also getting little sleep. got tested on day 7. 

day 9-18 - found out i tested negative/was a relief but also thought well wtf else do i have? followed up with my doc and he prescribed me a z-pack and trazodone for sleep. had one night where the chest burning was awful but that was the only night. diarrhea persisted throughout these days. felt like i was improving day by day, even got my appetite back around but still had waves of feeling like shit. maybe the z pack was working??? had horrible anxiety/panic attacks throughout these days though but once i recognized what symptoms were anxiety related i started to relax. 

day 19-24 (today) - horrible acid reflux kicks up. tums wonâ€™t work, probiotics didnâ€™t really help. stomach has been churning for 2 weeks now. even got some reflux laryngitis that comes and goes. fleeting sharp pains dead center in my sternum and also some sore chest muscles that comes in waves as well. going to get tested again on tuesday. started omeprazole on day 19. acid reflux subsided today. bad news though! bloated like a mfer today. belching like crazy. mild sob when iâ€™m sitting down, getting up and walking helps which leads me to believe it has something to do with the abdominal distension pushing on my diaphragm (iâ€™m hoping so anyway). also got whooshing tinnitus that appeared out of nowhere earlier today. 

iâ€™m so burnt out but i know iâ€™ve been extremely lucky to this point. thatâ€™s not lost on me but being stuck in a 2 bedroom apartment by myself for 24 days has been terrible. i know my anxiety could be the cause for some of my symptoms but i know my body well enough. also: have a telehealth appt with a psychologist on monday to address my anxiety. the past 3 weeks have been eye opening in how i need to address my mental and physical health, hope others here will do the same.

btw, typing all this shit out is making me feel a little better. 

have been taking:

-vit c
-vit d3
-zinc
-allergy med
-20bil probiotic
-tums as needed
-started simethicone today but iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s working

my flatmate and his gf came back from a hotbed of covid19 and decided to quarantine in our flat without my permission. surprise surprise gf gets sick with a fever then my flatmate does. they don't bother telling me or isolating in their room and use all of the common spaces. in fact, they tried to hide the fact that they were sick from me and i had to repeatedly ask them if they were sick. a week later i get sick with fever and a positive sars-cov2. i am immunocompromised with asthma and also work in healthcare with other immunocompromised people so i was really upset. i'm more or less fine and my chest xray was clear but this could have been really bad. my roommate didn't apologize, doesn't take any precautions, and is overall ambivalent to the situation about exposing me and everyone else he gets in contact with. he still has a cough and congestion but goes out on walks, picks up food, basically not really caring if he goes out or not because it's ""fine if he's 6 feet away from anyone"". this situation is really frustrating because this is someone i thought i could trust and i didn't think that people this negligent exist but apparently i live with one. i guess this is how covid19 spreads to the community. 

if you are suspected of covid19 please stay home and do your best to prevent the spread, don't be selfish. even if your symptoms are mild, there's a good chance the person who you expose ends up in the hospital.",$$$but$$$frustrated$$$away$$$but$$$came$$$thought$$$fever$$$fever$$$but$$$goes$$$cough$$$goes$$$,$$$Pyrexia$$$Irritability$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Cough$$$Palpitations$$$,$$$C0015967$$$C0022107$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0010200$$$C0030252$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

fyrth8,2020-04-10 19:42:00 UTC,"so, today i finally got discharged from the covid ward. i did not test positive but according to doctors, the test is kinda sketchy.

i started having symptoms 17 days ago, slight runny nose which later evolved into fever, joint pain, upset stomach, congested nose, the whole 9 yards. 

on day four, fever cleared up, cough had gotten wet and nose had started to clog up, my breathing had started becoming more intense, but nothing i could not handle, 

day five and six i made remarkable progress to heal, my fever was completely gone, nose was clearing up,  and i thought it was a cold/flue/mild case of covid.

then came day 8... i woke up with a tight chest. it was odd, but i still felt better than i did on day five. but then came the night, my heart began racing, i became dizzy and fatigued, started calling family to ask about things i had asked them about hours ago, but forgotten. fever came back, still not as bad as previous top from the earlier days (40,3 top meassured) but still around 39.4. 

i fought through day 9 and day 10, delusional, i thought i ate, i thought i drank, but i didnt. i spoke to my mom in the evening, and she heard how weak i was getting, and she told me to call healthcare. i did and got a time the day after, i called again in the morning to reassure i had a time cause of my confusion. the nurse this time wanted to send me an ambulance cause she also heard i was getting weak.

i went in, took the test and got discharged from the testing site. came back home, called mom and went to bed. i woke up by the phone ringing and it was the dr telling me i tested negative, and went back to sleep, phone rang again, and this time it was my mom (who has been working in hospital her whole life and spoke to a colleague, a paramedic about me, and the paramedic wanted to take me to hospital) i went down to the ambulance and headed to hospital, saturation was 95~ pulse 150, low blood pressure and hard irregular breathing. and everything from me waking up from the phonecall to here is a blurr. 

after two hours in the er for bloodtest and fluids, they told me despite my negative test that i'm a presumptive covid case. i went up to the ward and slept almost 30 hours, only waking up to eat, toilet and controls, my pulse, blood pressure and breathing was still really out of whack.

during my time on the ward, everything was out of whack, i had high blood pressure, low blood pressure, high pulse laying down (110) high pulse standing up, heavy breathing, cough. high saturation, low saturation.



i had a chest x-ray and got cleared, i had no pneumonia. 

and today, on day five, they deemed me ""healthy"" enough to go home.

and if i didnt go in the second time, i'm sure i'd had a hard time.


i wanted to write this text to a) remind people to drink drink and drink. eat when possible, and dont play with your health. 

b) recollect my experience.

c) help getting some stories out there.

fywdto,2020-04-11 00:24:00 UTC,"i'm 27, m and most importantly, morbidly obese. i'm not sloppy at all, and my weight is proportional, but i have a high bmi, which is why this is really terrifying me since obese men have very high mortality rates to covid.  

my symptoms started seven days ago exactly(4/3), i felt a really bad sense of malaise, heavy breathing after just walking up steps, exhaustion, chest tightness and had mild chills, almost thought i'd be having a heart attack. figured i'd try and sleep it off, and see how i felt in the morning. morning comes, feel much better, still very minor chest tightness, but not bad at all. 

the following days come and i'm pretty much the same since then, no real pain, but some chest tightness and heavy breathing from climbing up a flight of stairs(which has persisted), an occasional cough(can count on my hand how many times it's happened) and i got really bad chills on (4/8) just minutes before bed. 

i woke up on 4/11 and felt worse, not debilitating, just 20-30 worse, a little lightheaded, and my body being was a little heavy for me to move. also, i have a burning sensation in my lungs at times, and shorts jabs of pain in my upper right-hand chest area.

i'm horrified i might have undiagnosed pneumonia, ards, hypoxemia, or my organs might generally just be shutting down on me slowly. i've started taking zinc and vitamin d3 as of an hour ago, but all i see are stories of how the symptoms go from mild to severe to death in like 2 days for some big guys and it's really freaking me out. i'd feel better if i could go to the hospital for at least an x-ray of my lungs, but i live in nyc and the hospitals are effing slammed right now, and i don't want to have to fake symptoms.

can someone help talk me off the ledge here?

fznjpl,2020-04-11 21:36:00 UTC,"i wanted to make a post about this because it seems common enough, and i don't see it discussed much. probably because not many people have made it to the 30 day mark yet.

long story short, i'm 32m, no health issues, normal weight, but a lazy lifestyle. i had classic symptoms sans cough, diagnosed presumed positive starting 3/10. mostly recovered by day 14, feeling 100% by day 18 (3/28). 

fast forward to day 28(4/7). feeling fine until just after lunch i get slapped with a tipsy drunk feeling and really heavy fatigue. it's unmistakably a sick feeling. slight aches here and there too. i'm at work and stick it out for the rest of the day (no worries, only 2 other people in building). afterwards the sick feeling starts fading away, then coming back strong, then fading, coming back. almost on like a 30 minute/1 hour cycle.

day 29, feeling better upon waking up, but sleep cut short by trouble sleeping.brush off yesterday's feelings. but then feeling sick again an hour into work. throat feeling a bit soar with a little tickle, lungs a little heavy. by lunch feeling better again, although not much appetite. then feeling worse again later. pretty much this ""sick/not sick"" cycle continues. decide i'm not gonna do anything drastic unless a fever develops.

day 30, overall feeling better than the day before. sick/not sick cycle continues all day but less pronounced. throat feeling real sore in the evening and light chest pressure. still no fever.

day 31, very distant feelings of sick. take a long call in the morning and throat/lungs getting worn out quick by talking. appetite mostly back for lunch. by nighttime i'm eating a full dinner and feel almost totally back to normal.

day 32 (today), some minor throat irritation, but lungs/chest feel fine. no sick feelings and appetite is back. i'm hoping this is it.

fzny6o,2020-04-11 22:02:00 UTC,"hi y'all,

burner account but wanted to share my details in case they could be helpful for others -- this sub was an excellent resource for me in the do-i-have-it-or-not weeks before i could be tested! me: 30s f, good health/no underlying issues, california.

i got my first symptoms 3.5 weeks ago -- a sudden sore throat & cough. those lasted a day.

day 1-8: fatigue, sneezing, generally feeling ""off."" family was convinced i didn't have it, but i assumed i did. or did i?? i talked myself in & out of having it every day. without a fever/cough/shortness of breath, i thought i might just be paranoid. 

day 8: sudden & complete lack of smell. well, shit. immediately self-isolated and waited for things to change -- i didn't meet the testing criteria in my state, and i didn't want to take a test away from someone who needed it during a shortage (thanks, federal govt).  

days 9 - today (day 24) have been a combination of fatigue, nausea, muscle aches and a continued lack of smell and most taste. annoying but mild, so i'm counting my blessings. 

i finally qualified for a test on day 22, and when i got my results on day 23, my doctor said he was surprised that i could test positive after 3 weeks of such mild symptoms. me too! but i'm grateful for the clarity and especially that i could be tested in my state, when so many americans still can't. 

good luck to everyone still wondering out there -- and tell any of your friends or family that even if they quarantined for 14 days, that still may not be enough to clear the virus. i was also under the mistaken impression that positive = antibodies = immunity (hooray!), and have now learned that not all antibodies are immunity-antibodies. super. hang in there everyone ðÿ’ª",$$$breath$$$away$$$cough$$$fatigue$$$cough$$$state$$$before$$$taste$$$but$$$smell$$$thought$$$nausea$$$smell$$$but$$$self$$$throat$$$fatigue$$$but$$$muscle$$$but$$$state$$$fever$$$sneezing$$$,$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Ageusia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Nausea$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Myalgia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Pyrexia$$$Sneezing$$$,$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0012833$$$C0013456$$$C2364111$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0027497$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C2363731$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0231528$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C0037383$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
fzprrm,2020-04-12 00:08:00 UTC,"3 weeks ago i was tested for covid. i went into isolation and was told i would receive the results in 5 days (ha!). after i got tested i developed severe flu like symptoms (acheyness, fever, bedridden) accompanied by sever cold like symptoms. i couldnâ€™t taste or smell. this went on for about a week. a week after i was tested i was feeling a bit better but still exhausted. still no covid results. 9 days after being tested i took a turn for the worst and ended up in the hospital to be rehydrated. i was treated as a presumed positive, took a bunch of tests, another covid test, and was rehydrated and went home that day. they tested me for mono and it was negative. the following day i developed a severe sore throat to accompany all my other symptoms. the next day i got both my covid test results (twelve day wait and then the one from the hospital) both negative. over the following week i was struggling, i was in the worst shape of my life. getting food or water down was an impossible feat. my throat was unreal, i was completey congested, i had pneumonia in my chest and was coughing all the time, and was dehydrated and hungry. i was on steroids, tylenol and a painkiller. i also used lidocaine daily. nothing helped but the lidocaine. this was a miserable week. after this week went by, i was still in severe throat pain and was feeling all the symptoms. my doctor recommended i get checked out by an ent at the hospital. they ended up admitting me because i was unable to eat or drink due to the throat pain. i have been in the hospital for 5 days now. i have taken a total of 5 covid tests, 3 negative and 2 positive. i also tested positive for mono when i got admitted to the hospital. iâ€™m recovering and the only symptom i have now is my throat pain.

iâ€™ve lost almost 30 pounds during this almost 4 week ordeal. i havenâ€™t been able to smell or taste for 2.5 weeks. i ate for the first time today in two weeks. the doctors were clueless on how to handle my case because the testing was so inconsistent and it didnâ€™t make sense. 

i hope no one on the planet has to go thru what i have. the sore throat iâ€™ve had for two weeks is the worst pain iâ€™ve ever experienced in my entire life. iâ€™m hopeful i will be healthy in the next few days. please be grateful for your health.

fzyljx,2020-04-12 11:24:00 UTC,"iâ€™m 28 years old, o+, bmi of 32 and no significant past medical history except for asthma as a child but i havenâ€™t needed an inhaler in over 15 years. live in nyc and work in a hospital with a lot of covid cases.

day 1: worked a 12 hour shift and felt totally fine just a little tired which is normal for me because i donâ€™t get enough sleep. came home and immediately laid down i felt so fatigued, and then developed severe chills. put on three blankets and then took my temperature which was 99.9.

day 2: woke up covered in sweat which had soaked the sheets, i actually thought my dog had peed the bed or something before realizing it was me sweating. had a sinus type headache all day but my fever was gone now (98.7). rested all day since i was off work

day 3: went to work hoping to be sent home by employee health, but as my temperature was normal and i didnâ€™t have any symptoms at the time they told me to work. worked 12 hour shift in the office (so luckily only interacted with 3 people) with just a headache. then again when i got home from work the chills started again- my core and head felt very warm but hands and feet were freezing. temp 99.2

day 4: woke up drenched in cold sweat again, felt like something in my throat was making my airway slightly smaller. coughed up some greenish yellow mucous in the morning. temp stayed around 97.9 all day.

day 5: woke up again drenched in sweat, had some weird fever dreams where i spoke to my dead grandma. felt like i was never fully sleeping or awake overnight. mild cough started but taking a hot shower helped with that. as usual temperature was pretty good until the afternoon, where it shot up to 100.4 with chills. took some mucinex and acetaminophen. 

day 6: couldnâ€™t sleep all night, cough worsening and called out of work and told them iâ€™m very sure i have the coronavirus. my boss told me to come to the hospital to get tested. showed up and my vitals were temp 99.6, blood pressure 140/88, and heart rate 130bpm (!!!). they swabbed me and then sent me to the ed for more testing because of my high heart rate. spent 5 hours in the ed and got an ekg, chest x-ray, ct angio with contrast, blood tests and urine test. i will put all the results at the end of the post but basically they told me my ct showed pneumonia in all lines of my lungs so they are very confident i have coronavirus. was told to self isolate at home, no meds prescribed.

day 7: woke up three times in the night with diarrhea. able to control my temperature better by waking up in the middle of the night to take more acetaminophen. morning temp (after meds) 98.3. ordered a bunch of supplies on amazon but they wonâ€™t come for a few days which stinks (nebulizer, imodium for diarrhea). gonna organize a telehealth meeting with my primary doctor later today hopefully to get like a z-pack or inhaler or something.

**my test results:**

-chest x-ray was totally normal

-ekg was normal

-bloodwork mostly normal except for low co2, very high crp, and low auto lymph. 

-ct angio chest: â€œ large ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening (""crazy paving"") in the medial right lower lobe, with some areas of consolidation, and multiple additional ground-glass nodules scattered throughout the lungs, right lung greater than left. these represent commonly reported imaging features of covid-19 pneumonia. please note other infectious and inflammatory processes can cause a similar imaging pattern.â€œ


*updates below:*

day 7 continued: so i scheduled a telehealth call with my primary doctor, who unfortunately told me that he couldn't prescribe me any medications because there isn't enough evidence to support anything (i wanted a z-pack). he told me to go to the hospital if my breathing rapidly declines, but that because of my age i will most likely be fine. in the afternoon and night i had diarrhea 4 times. 

day 8: for once i didn't wake up covered in sweat which was really cool and i got like 10 hours of sleep which was much needed. however, i woke up with a 7/10 in severity headache localized to the top left part of my head and i never get headaches like this. i took some headache meds (combo caffeine and acetaminophen pill), ate an edible and put an icepack on my head and it was gone in 2 hours. overall i might feel slightly better today but i am kind of afraid of saying that in case i jinx myself. also started some breathing exercises today and ordered some turmeric pills online which are supposed to be good for inflammation.

day 9: i actually feel legitimately good today, like 70% back to normal. letâ€™s see if it stays that way or if itâ€™s another coronavirus mood swing. no fevers and less coughing today. either way iâ€™m just happy for the burst of optimism itâ€™s giving me

day 10: feel great today- only symptoms are lungs feeling 20% impaired still and one instance of diarrhea. got the nebulizer today and i honestly feel really good after i use it so iâ€™m gonna do it a few times a day, especially once before bed. i probably am going back to work sometime next week as iâ€™ve been fever free for 2 days now",$$$diarrhea$$$fatigued$$$glass$$$diarrhea$$$headache$$$before$$$awake$$$but$$$sweat$$$sleep$$$diarrhea$$$self$$$sweat$$$headache$$$headaches$$$but$$$something$$$heart rate$$$temp$$$chills$$$sweating$$$but$$$breathing$$$fever$$$headache$$$head$$$warm$$$sinus$$$came$$$coughing$$$something$$$temp$$$heart rate$$$cough$$$fever$$$pneumonia$$$glass$$$sometime$$$head$$$temp$$$ate$$$but$$$temp$$$diarrhea$$$temperature$$$but$$$similar$$$sleep$$$chills$$$sleeping$$$fevers$$$fever$$$thought$$$sweat$$$tired$$$head$$$throat$$$but$$$temperature$$$temperature$$$before$$$pneumonia$$$headache$$$chills$$$but$$$but$$$something$$$but$$$breathing$$$sweat$$$cough$$$inflammation$$$sleep$$$coughed$$$temperature$$$,$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Fatigue$$$Dyspnea$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Headache$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Headache$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Palpitations$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Headache$$$Headache$$$Hot Flush$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$other$$$Dyspnea$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Loss of appetite$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest pain$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Chills$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Fatigue$$$Headache$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$other$$$Headache$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Cough$$$other$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$,$$$C0011991$$$C0015672$$$C0013404$$$C0011991$$$C0018681$$$C0013456$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0020458$$$C0917801$$$C0011991$$$C0012833$$$C0020458$$$C0018681$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C0030252$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C0020458$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C0018681$$$C0600142$$$C0948596$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0000000$$$C0013404$$$C0917801$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0232462$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0008031$$$C0917801$$$C0085593$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0020458$$$C0015672$$$C0018681$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0000000$$$C0018681$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0020458$$$C0010200$$$C0000000$$$C0917801$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

fzzml1,2020-04-12 12:21:00 UTC,"23m, healthy, no underlying conditions, tested positive. my case has been pretty mild overall, but like many others, frustratingly nonlinear in its progression. hence the title.

3/27: first symptoms appear. slightly elevated temperature and extreme dizziness, feel light-headed every time i move. everything else feels fine.

3/28: dizziness persists, if not worsens. intense headaches, some of the most painful i've ever experienced, come and go--feels like something is trying to violently force its way out of my temples. the headaches never last long, but keep returning. develop a slight dry cough.

3/29: takes me about two hours after waking, while eating brunch, to realize that i've totally lost my sense of smell and therefore my sense of taste. i can distinguish between sugary, sour, bitter etc., but the flavor is completely gone. develop a low-grade fever, with temperature shooting up to 100f. dizziness persists. i got a referral for testing, received my results on 4/2--positive.

3/30-4/1: dizziness fades, but headaches recur. sense of smell remains totally absent, only thing i can even remotely smell is ketchup, for whatever reason. for a few days, i feel a painful burning sensation in my nose. at one point develop some serious pain on the right side of my face, near my jaw. dry cough worsens, but not by much. increasing fatigue and lethargy, could have stayed in bed all day if i let myself.

4/2: after a day of feeling pretty fine, develop chest pain at night. dry cough worsens.

4/3-4/5: at this point, feels like i'm well on my way to a full recovery. can smell a few things, like lemons, cologne, and hand sanitizer, if i bring them right up to my nose. most of my other symptoms fade, though the passing headaches remain.

4/6: abruptly devolve into a violent coughing fit at night, airways feel like they're burning up, stabbing chest pain develops.

4/7: persistent pressure on chest, pain sharpens whenever i take a deep breath or cough. muscle aches in neck, shoulder, arms, and legs that come and go. intense fatigue. meanwhile, sense of smell improves, can begin to vaguely taste some of my food again.

4/8: chest pain worsens again, can breathe fine but hurts whenever i do, which is all the time, obviously. less tired.

4/9: chest feels very strange at night, like something is seeping through my lungs. dry cough worsens.  general fatigue, sleep most of the day. at this point, can smell almost anything so long as i bring it right up to my nose. emphasis on ""almost,"" some smells still remain elusive.

4/10: chest pain finally relents, feel more energized in general. dry cough improves.

4/11: for the first time since 3/29, can detect smells that aren't emanating from objects directly under my nose. no chest pain, barely coughing. feel pretty great for most of the day, but at night i vomit basically everything i ate for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. feel some nausea afterwards.

4/12: well, things turn south again quickly. dry cough worsens dramatically, and thereâ€™s some shortness of breath. canâ€™t take a deep breath without revolving into a coughing fit. chest pain returns. 

4/13: after a restless night, wake up with low-grade fever (99.6f) and headache. dry cough and shortness of breath remains. 

i'll update this daily. in general, recovery has has been a dance of taking two steps forward and one step back. the progression of this disease has not been linear. i keep having multi-day stretches where things feel like they're on the upswing before taking an abrupt downturn. still, i'm grateful for having what has so far been a pretty mild case, relatively speaking. hoping it stays that way.",$$$fever$$$coughing$$$elevated temperature$$$cough$$$but$$$burning$$$low grade fever$$$grade fever$$$temperature$$$but$$$nose$$$temperature$$$stabbing$$$but$$$painful$$$coughing fit$$$jaw$$$before$$$sense$$$breath$$$theyre$$$but$$$grade fever$$$fatigue$$$theyre$$$ate$$$painful$$$something$$$speaking$$$fatigue$$$sense$$$arms$$$cough$$$smell$$$smell$$$smell$$$breathe$$$cough$$$neck$$$sense$$$sense$$$tired$$$lethargy$$$cough$$$but$$$smell$$$headaches$$$coughing fit$$$sleep$$$muscle$$$breath$$$general fatigue$$$nausea$$$headaches$$$dizziness$$$taste$$$headaches$$$taste$$$cough$$$nose$$$breath$$$fever$$$cough$$$breath$$$headache$$$light headed$$$dizziness$$$burning$$$but$$$cough$$$dizziness$$$fatigue$$$legs$$$but$$$headaches$$$smell$$$nose$$$something$$$nose$$$coughing$$$dizziness$$$coughing$$$smell$$$cough$$$low grade fever$$$,$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest pain$$$Cough$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Anosmia$$$Dyspnea$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Loss of appetite$$$Chest pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Fatigue$$$Anosmia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Cough$$$Anosmia$$$Anosmia$$$Anosmia$$$Dyspnea$$$Cough$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Anosmia$$$Anosmia$$$Fatigue$$$Lethargic$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Headache$$$Cough$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Myalgia$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Nausea$$$Headache$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Ageusia$$$Headache$$$Ageusia$$$Cough$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Headache$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Chest pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Fatigue$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Headache$$$Anosmia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Chest tightness$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Cough$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Cough$$$Anosmia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$,$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0008031$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1260880$$$C0015967$$$C0008031$$$C0015967$$$C0008031$$$C0010200$$$C0741585$$$C0013456$$$C0003126$$$C0013404$$$C1260880$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C1260880$$$C0232462$$$C0008031$$$C0235710$$$C0012833$$$C0015672$$$C0003126$$$C0741585$$$C0010200$$$C0003126$$$C0003126$$$C0003126$$$C0013404$$$C0010200$$$C0741585$$$C0003126$$$C0003126$$$C0015672$$$C0023380$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0018681$$$C0010200$$$C0917801$$$C0231528$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0027497$$$C0018681$$$C0012833$$$C2364111$$$C0018681$$$C2364111$$$C0010200$$$C1260880$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0018681$$$C0012833$$$C0012833$$$C0008031$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0012833$$$C0015672$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C0003126$$$C1260880$$$C0235710$$$C1260880$$$C0010200$$$C0012833$$$C0010200$$$C0003126$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
g025b1,2020-04-12 14:39:00 UTC,"i posted this in the daily discussion thread but figured it might get more visibility as its own thread. 

im a 28/m, no preexisting health conditions, normal bmi. confirmed positive and currently on day 6. my symptoms have been mild so far. started tuesday 4/7 with what i thought were allergies (runny nose, slight sinus headache, itchy/watery eyes, very occasional dry cough). thinking it was allergies i took claritin d which had no effect.  

later that night i had an elevated temperature of 99.65. developed chills which bothered me all night. the following morning my temp was 100.19 and the earlier described symptoms continued with the addition of a dull pain on my eyes when i moved them up/down/left/right - never felt a sensation like that before. i called my local hospital and they had me tested later that day (4/8). symptoms continued through the following day (4/9) which is when i received the call confirming i was positive.  highest my temp ever got was 100.40 and i havent experienced any shortness of breath or uncomfortable chest sensations. 

since 4/10 i've been feeling pretty good. my temp has been normal (high 96s to low 98s), my headache is gone, and my eyes arent bothering me anymore, and my blood o2 is 97-99%. i still have an occasional runny nose and a very infrequent cough.  regardless i am still in isolation - but if i didnt pay as close of attention to my symptoms and didnt get tested i would probably be outside running today.  i live with my fiance and she has been totally fine and symptom free throughout. 

does this sound familar to anyone? and now the impossible question... if this does sound familar, any idea on if i should get better or worse from here? i know im not out of the storm yet but i keep seeing stories on this sub of people who had mild symptoms that then got significantly worse. i dont know if im freaking myself out unnecessarily.",$$$developed chills$$$nose$$$headache$$$runny nose$$$temp$$$temp$$$temperature$$$eyes$$$before$$$but$$$breath$$$cough$$$eyes$$$chills$$$temp$$$but$$$elevated temperature$$$cough$$$headache$$$but$$$thought$$$nose$$$sinus$$$runny nose$$$eyes$$$,$$$Chills$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Headache$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Eye pain$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Cough$$$Eye pain$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Eye pain$$$,$$$C0085593$$$C1260880$$$C0018681$$$C1260880$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0151827$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0010200$$$C0151827$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1260880$$$C0948596$$$C1260880$$$C0151827$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
g06yiz,2020-04-12 19:12:00 UTC,"hello everyone, 

i wanted to post about my experience with covid19. iâ€™m not over it yet, but i think i am past the worst. 

i am 30 and female. i smoke usually 7-10 cigarettes a day and am considered overweight. blood type is a+ if that matters.

this whole thing started nearly 2 weeks ago, on the 30th of march. in the uk, lockdown had been established on the 23rd, and during the first week of lockdown i left the house once, for food shopping. unfortunately that was enough. 

week 1: 

monday morning i wake up with a sore throat. itâ€™s not terrible but itâ€™s tender and it is scratchy, it sort of catches when i breath in a manner i would describe as almost itchy. i have an urge to cough, but not to the extent that i actually do cough. 

tuesday is similar. 

wednesday i start to cough a little bit. itâ€™s dry, itâ€™s actually quite pathetic sounding. no depth to it. i start to feel a bit sweaty so i check my temperature. itâ€™s 38 degrees, or 100.4 for those of you who work in mad numbers. i consider taking ibuprofen for my sore throat as itâ€™s really quite painful now but my friend, who is a nurse, tells me not to over whatsapp and says to take paracetamol instead. it helps, temperature goes down a bit and my throat feels better.

thursday the annoying cough is still there. my temperature is at 39/ 102 and iâ€™m struggling to work, eat, focus, do anything. 

friday i feel awful, i just want to sleep. still a high temp. my throat feels better though. 

saturday and sunday. i feel on the mend! suddenly, i can swallow. my temperature is still higher than usual, but below 38. i make use of my newly found energy by cleaning the balcony and marvel at how quickly these things can pass. 

week 2

monday. oh shit. i was so so wrong. the cough has become a hacking bark and it wonâ€™t stop. my temperature rockets. iâ€™m in bed all day. then thereâ€™s a sharp pain in my ear that gradually radiates through to my jaw. has this all just been an ear infection? i speak to a nurse over the phone and manage to get antibiotics. i get ear infections fairly regularly when iâ€™m run down or have a cold. i start to wonder whether all these symptoms have just been a lead up to an ear infection. later on that night, i get my husband to dig out my asthma inhaler because iâ€™m starting to feel light headed. 

tuesday. getting out of bed to go to the loo is hard, iâ€™m that tired. my boss tells me to log off and rest. i start to worry and anxiety is high. i canâ€™t work out whether anxiety is causing me not to breath properly or whether i have indeed got coronavirus. i imagine myself alone in a hospital bed, hooked up to a ventilator, unable to to speak to or see my family. my daughter is only 16 months old, she would grow up not remembering me if i died now. suddenly i really canâ€™t breath. my husband wants to call an ambulance. i tell him not to, this is a panic attack. in all honesty though i had no idea whether itâ€™s a panic attack or whether iâ€™m genuinely struggling to breath. he calls 111. they send out a paramedic. my oxygen levels are down a little, my blood pressure is sky high, but my lungs are sounding clear. he manages to qualify me for testing, due to my job. iâ€™m told i will receive a call to book in and then i will need to access a link online once i am at the testing centre in order to receive the test. he offers me to go to hospital. i say iâ€™d rather not. he tells me thatâ€™s the right answer, and you donâ€™t want to see the state of the local hospitals right now. he tells me to ring 999 if anything gets any worse though. 

wednesday. the test happens. the cough is now so bad that once i start i canâ€™t stop and i often end up vomiting. my head is aching like my brain is rattling against it when i cough. trying to sleep at night is futile. i take sleep where i can during the day. every time i breath in my muscles poise themselves to cough, i try to fight it because the pain of coughing is now immense. my ear is still throbbing with pain. whether thatâ€™s connected to the presumed coronavirus i donâ€™t know.

thursday. same again really. my ear is now so blocked iâ€™m struggling to hear properly, but the pain is subsiding which is a relief. i go to bed at 6pm and sleep until 8am, with a few wake ups for coughing fits. 

friday. much the same. although now the sore throat is back just to really compound the agony. this time it feels like a more conventional sore throat, perhaps brought on by all the coughing. 

saturday. [call received that i am positive] a lot of sleep, still coughing but the coughing comes in more spaced out fits rather than a constant. the cough is productive now, lots of very jelly like yellow mucus. some of it has flecks of red blood in it. usually this would bother me, but honestly i am so low on energy that nothing surprises me now. i could starting pissing blue and iâ€™d probably shrug and go back to bed. saturday morning was first time i woke up with a normal temperature in days though. 

sunday (today!) only 2 coughing fits today still very fatigued. unable to do much. throat feels like someone has rubbed shattered glass shards on it, itâ€™s fucking awful and even swallowing my own saliva hurts. i shine my phone into my mouth and the back is red and enflamed. ear no longer hurting but still blocked, mild tinnitus and lots of clicking sounds. still unsure if the ear is connected to covid19. temperature still normal. breathing fine. 

i hope the throat starts to get better soon and the fatigue starts to shake off. this is unlike anything iâ€™ve had before. 

if i get over this i am 100% committed to losing weight and giving up smoking.",$$$but$$$ear$$$levels$$$throat$$$light headed$$$breath$$$cough$$$coughing$$$breathing$$$throat$$$cough$$$but$$$throat$$$sleep$$$jaw$$$but$$$throat$$$anxiety$$$cough$$$breath$$$goes$$$ear$$$ear$$$but$$$ear$$$glass$$$ear$$$muscles$$$aching$$$agony$$$temp$$$worry$$$cough$$$fatigued$$$sharp$$$energy$$$coughing fits$$$temperature$$$but$$$panic attack$$$cough$$$but$$$but$$$fatigue$$$cough$$$eat$$$pass$$$sleep$$$energy$$$throat$$$coughing fits$$$sleep$$$throat$$$degrees$$$focus$$$cough$$$temperature$$$cough$$$sweaty$$$painful$$$anxiety$$$ear$$$coughing$$$panic$$$panic attack$$$coughing$$$alone$$$coughing$$$coughing$$$tired$$$before$$$sleep$$$head$$$whole$$$similar$$$sleep$$$vomiting$$$swallowing$$$panic$$$panic attack$$$annoying cough$$$state$$$breath$$$panic attack$$$ear$$$temperature$$$throat$$$breath$$$throat$$$temperature$$$temperature$$$but$$$breath$$$ear$$$coughing$$$temperature$$$cough$$$mucus$$$but$$$temperature$$$but$$$,"$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$other$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Dyspnea$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Palpitations$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Myalgia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Chest pain$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Loss of appetite$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Fatigue$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Cough$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Chest pain$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Cough$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Headache$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Chest pain$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Vomiting$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Dyspnea$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$other$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$",$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0000000$$$C2363731$$$C0012833$$$C0013404$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C2363731$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0917801$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0030252$$$C0013456$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0013404$$$C0013456$$$C0231528$$$C0741585$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C0008031$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0232462$$$C0012833$$$C0917801$$$C0015672$$$C2363731$$$C0010200$$$C0917801$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0020458$$$C0008031$$$C1832070$$$C0013456$$$C0010200$$$C1832070$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C0013456$$$C0917801$$$C0018681$$$C0741585$$$C0008031$$$C0917801$$$C0042963$$$C2363731$$$C1832070$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0012833$$$C0013404$$$C1832070$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0013404$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0013456$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0000000$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
g086zd,2020-04-12 20:30:00 UTC,"i am 26f and had a borderline mild/severe case of covid19. my boyfriend shared my post previously and i've been keeping my own, more private post that i updated regularly. 

i have comorbidities that were exacerbated with this virus. i have heart disease (covid19 caused swelling around my heart in the very beginning of me getting sick) and asthma (breathing was very difficult at the height of my illness). 

i was not convinced that i had covid19 prior to testing and prior to receiving the results. i was at the worst prior to getting my results. i probably should have gone to the hospital but i was told not to unless my oxygen levels were below 90. i only had my phone to tell me what my oxygen levels were (and not sure how accurate they were) but in the heat of the moment (coughing and trying to catch my breath) i wasn't thinking about taking my oxygen levels. 

thankfully, i was able to recover in my own room... but from my first symptom to my last was 25 days. i'm still not back to where i was prior to getting sick and i'm worried that i may have lung damage... every now and then i catch myself trying to take a deep breath and can't still. i also find that i still can't exercise... walking up stairs (i live on the third floor) is still very difficult... 

is anyone else who is recovered going through this too? i want to start doing more but scared of stressing my heart or lungs in the event that there is damage...",$$$coughing$$$scared$$$but$$$breath$$$breath$$$levels$$$levels$$$but$$$but$$$catch$$$levels$$$breathing$$$catch$$$worried$$$but$$$,"$$$Cough$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$other$$$other$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$other$$$Dyspnea$$$Palpitations$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$",$$$C0010200$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0000000$$$C0000000$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0000000$$$C0013404$$$C0030252$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

g0r8nq,2020-04-13 16:45:00 UTC,"hi everyone. it has been  3 weeks since life as i knew it changed. i tried my best to document the beginning of all this here:

&#x200b;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/covid19\_support/comments/fw0j4n/46\_final\_update\_on\_my\_mother\_she\_passed\_away\_due/](https://www.reddit.com/r/covid19_support/comments/fw0j4n/46_final_update_on_my_mother_she_passed_away_due/)

&#x200b;

i know no one can give any real concrete facts but i'm just looking for opinions. i'm pretty sure my exposure came on or before march 24th when i took my mother to the er. she died after testing  positive on april 3rd.

my father who is 60, aunt who is 58 and younger brother and i went to get one of those drive thru tests on march 30th. 2 days later i tested positive, my father and brother tested negative, my aunts test never came back. we have stayed in the same house quarantined, separated as best we can since march 25th when my mother went in and the er doctor told us to.

i got retested at another one of those drive thru places  april 7th and 10th, both came back negative, my aunt came with me on the 10th and her test never came back.

these entire 3 weeks none of us have shown any real symptoms. the los angeles county health department called me to interview me and a nurse told me it makes no sense that  my father and aunt who were in extremely close contact to my sick mother leading up to her death didn't test positive or show symptoms, yet i did after just taking her to the er.

this entire time i have been closely monitoring how i feel each day, taking my temperate twice a day, being very aware of any coughs, even got one of those oxygen finger monitor things.  nothing has happened yet.

the only thing that's a bit different is my throat feels a bit dry today, only difference in my routine is last night i drank a ton of coffee and a 5 hour energy ( don't ask ). i know those swab tests aren't totally accurate so something horrible can still happen, especially after i've read so many terrifying things about reinfection often happening. i've spoken to about 4 doctors and nurses on the phone, everyone of them said it's strange nothing has happened to me yet, and actually admitted they can't give any real concrete advice because they are all just giving guesses at this point.

my father finally went back to work at his factory where there have been 5 people who tested positive in the past, i'm just scared to death at that thought.

&#x200b;

has anyone else heard of someone by asymptomatic for this long and things still taking a bad turn? thank you to anyone who took the time to read this.

g0s76t,2020-04-13 17:36:00 UTC,"i have been anxiously wondering if i would be ever so slightly immune to covid-19 due to the fact that i've been on hydroxychloroquine for a long period of time. i was diagnosed with mixed connective tissue disease in my early 20's and have a pretty mild form of it, although my wbc has been on the lower end since starting the hydro (ironically, i don't really get sick (colds, flu) that much anymore). anyways, here's my story.

2/28 - came down with a random cold, really bad body aches, sore throat + ear pain, no fever. lasts about 3-4 days. i felt mostly fine, but the fatigue was almost alarming. my husband and i had just gotten back from a weekend in ri and i realize i haven't taken my hydro for about 3-4 days. i take it that friday night. my husband gets sick a few days later with the same thing. (99% sure this is just a random cold, but including it because the fatigue was out of this world for the both of us)

3/23-24 - i start to feel sick around 6 pm. is it a flare or covid? i wake up on 3/24 and my cheeks are flushed. temp is normally around 97.7, it goes up to 99.0. again, extremely fatigued and feel feverish but otherwise ok. i return back to normal on 3/25. assume it's just a flare because i didn't have a fever, or any other symptoms. my nephew wakes up with a fever on 3/23 as well (more on that below).

3/26 - 3/27 my husband and my brother work together in their shop. on 3/28 we get a phone call from my brother saying he's headed to urgent care. three days prior my 1 year old nephew who had a fever sneezed in his mouth. he has a fever, sore throat and some difficulty breathing (he has asthma). they test him, but we don't get the results until 4/4. he tests positive.

at this point, my husband and i have been working from home since 3/28 because of my brothers symptoms.

3/28 -3/30 - i start to  experience some gi symptoms. nothing too crazy. i almost vomit on 3/28 and have had loose stools. (yay)

3/30 pm - oh no, it's almost tuesday again and i feel like i'm getting a fever. am i going to feel like this every tuesday now? i wonder.

3/31 - i wake up with a 99.8 temp. never goes above 100. i feel feverish, achey and weak. my ears and throat mildly hurt.

4/1 - my ears and throat still hurt and my nose has the strangest feeling, almost like i got punched but without the pain. i realize my sense of taste and smell is gone by almost 80%, this is when i realize oh crap, we might have it. everything returns to normal for the most part. i sometimes feel like it's hard to breathe but i feel that was most likely my anxiety.

4/4 - my brother gets his results back, he's positive.

4/6 - i call my doctor and explain the situation. she writes me a script and i get tested on 4/7.

4/9 - around this time my sense of smell starts to return, but i haven't had a fever since 3/31. my husband never experiences any symptoms besides some slight vertigo and a sore throat.

4/13 - my doctor calls me and tells me i've tested positive. i've felt fine for quite some time now. i truly do not understand the situation anymore. did the hydroxychloroquine help me not get really sick? i feel like i won't ever really know the answer to that question for quite some time. but no, people who take hydroxychloroquine long term are absolutely not immune to this virus (cough) ;p

&#x200b;

anyways, that's my so far boring covid-19 story. did i get my brother sick or did he get it from a sneeze to the mouth from his toddler and then pass it on to us? the world may never know. stay safe everyone!",$$$throat$$$nose$$$achey$$$fever$$$cough$$$throat$$$but$$$but$$$throat$$$ear$$$difficulty breathing$$$anxiety$$$throat$$$feverish$$$sneezed$$$but$$$but$$$but$$$fatigue$$$vertigo$$$difficulty breathing$$$smell$$$gi$$$fatigue$$$but$$$pass$$$ears$$$goes$$$temp$$$ears$$$breathing$$$fever$$$fever$$$came$$$weak$$$feverish$$$fever$$$fever$$$sense$$$taste$$$fever$$$smell$$$but$$$but$$$fatigued$$$temp$$$fever$$$throat$$$sense$$$breathe$$$goes$$$sneeze$$$,"$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Sneezing$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Dyspnea$$$Anosmia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Palpitations$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Ageusia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Anosmia$$$Dyspnea$$$Palpitations$$$Sneezing$$$",$$$C2363731$$$C1260880$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0013456$$$C0013404$$$C1832070$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0037383$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0012833$$$C0013404$$$C0003126$$$C0011991$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C0013456$$$C0030252$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C2364111$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0003126$$$C0013404$$$C0030252$$$C0037383$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

g12tci,2020-04-14 06:01:00 UTC,"short back story since i don't know how to link my previous posts:

i've been sick for over a month and i've been detailing my symptoms as they changed and increased/decreased in severity and frequency. 

as of last week my doctor officially cleared me from self-isolation.  at first (3 weeks ago) she said it was 72 hours without fever and improvement in breathing as well as 7 days since first symptoms began. 

a week later, she said the criteria changed to 7 days with no fever (over 100.3) and 7 days since onset of symptoms with improved breathing.  however,  last week was the final word:

""i did confirm that it is just 72 hrs without symptoms to be able to return to work (though a small residual cough is allowed)""

i have been using a cortisol inhaler for the past week now, twice a day, even when i don't feel that i need it. my doctor said it's important to use it for at least 5 days straight to get the benefits. 

i've also been following a supplement routine from my naturopath doctor which includes an anti-viral mix you put in water, high doses of fish oil and high doses of curcumin. 

it's been at least 3 days since i felt i had any breathing difficulties or even any chest tightness,  but i've been careful not to overdo anything.  i've also tried to give myself more time to see if symptoms return since i've felt before like i was getting better. this might be the real deal!

i took a walk the other day and i didn't feel winded. i went to the grocery store a couple of days ago and i didn't get winded or tired so that was pretty cool.

i did get some diarrhea and headaches when i began the naturopath regimen last week but i did read that those two issues are common with high doses of fish oil so i am attributing those issues to that.

i am due to return to work this week and it will be nice to get out of the house. except for 2 walks, 2 grocery trips and 1 doctor's visit, i haven't left the apartment, even to check the mail, in going on 3 weeks now.

i would have to say i was recovered by day 34 - as in no symptoms at all. 

it's been a long journey that was really difficult mentally at times but here i am.  

if you want advice, i would say drink lots of water, reach out to your support network, and be an advocate for yourself: if your doctor is not listening or not helping,  please see a new doctor. please bring someone with you to advocate for you and your health.  your health is most important and it's imperative that your concerns be heard and your needs be addressed. 

thank you to everyone here that sent me messages of support and encouragement and for those who checked in on me.  it meant a lot to me to have people to talk to and to feel that i was not in this alone.",$$$tightness$$$fever$$$but$$$cough$$$but$$$breathing$$$self$$$fever$$$before$$$breathing$$$but$$$diarrhea$$$alone$$$breathing$$$breathing difficulties$$$headaches$$$tired$$$,$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Fatigue$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$Headache$$$Fatigue$$$,$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0015672$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0018681$$$C0015672$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
g137us,2020-04-14 06:37:00 UTC,"i felt like i had received a lot of comfort (and fear tbh) from this sub. 
i had kept a daily symptoms diary in my drafts these bumpy last few weeks, and let me tell you, there were some fâ€™n bumps... but the past four days have been almost symptom free. 

my story:
32 male, no underlying conditions. average in just about every way.. height, weight, etc.. 

weed smoker almost daily until 1st symptoms  (as youâ€™ll read, my breathing was the main symptom)
my husband does not smoke and has experienced almost the same symptoms minus breathing issues this whole time... i may be reconsidering smoking after this is over. 

throughout all of this iâ€™ve only had infrequent (couple times a day) productive coughs. every day of this recovery has been mild-moderate shortness of breath and a fluctuating and increased heart rate. 

â€”â€”-

march 10 - visited my brother. he had been exposed at work unknowingly. heâ€™s a doctor. he was coughing at night. there were only like 10 confirmed cases in ga at the time. he tested a few days later and got positive result about 8 days after... when he texted me.

march 17 - started feeling something.. in my chest. a tightness or fullness with my breathing. it got worse that night.

march 18 - my brother texted he was positive. and the dread set in. my breathing had been okay that morning but got worse during the day. tried meditation to regulate my breaths. i couldnâ€™t get a full breath. 

march 19-24 - a sore throat joined the tight chest. so did diarrhea. nasal drip. i had awful heartburn. the night of the 24th was dramatic. i was sick. low fever hit 99-100. had a panic attack and could not sleep. started having cold sweats for the first time in my life. i was actually afraid to sleep. i convinced my husband to stay up with me and keep me occupied. laying down was not an option.. i felt like i was getting about half the breath i was sucking in. when i would drift off to sleep, i would wake up feeling like i had been â€œmissingâ€ breaths. the morning couldnâ€™t come quick enough. tylenol knocked out the fever. chloresceptic spray helped my throat. 

march 25 - went to urgent care. like every day before, in the morning i felt better. i called ahead and they did a drive in curbside check up. she noted my increased heart rate (anxiety?) but that was it. my lungs sounded fine... i was kind of relieved but as a lot of us have heard â€œgo home and self isolateâ€ take care of the symptoms etc... that night wasnâ€™t so bad. no fever, just shortness of breath. 

26th-april 1st - random bouts of headaches, body aches, breathing seemed to be getting better. i was relieved. i could finally get a full night sleep. going up and down the stairs was hard. got winded easily again.

april 2nd - boom. infamous second wave.
i stared sweating and shivering. sweated through my clothes, drenched blanket. low fever 100-101. tylenol broke it in under 2 hours. i had the worst chills and sweats. i could not move in bed. i felt like my joints had been welded shut. i was blindsided and really scared. nausea and diarrhea started. my appetite was gone for 3 days. my throat was dry as a bone. i woke up every few hours feeling like i hadnâ€™t been breathing. my heart rate was all over the place. pounding in my chest. i started using a humidifier and it helped my throat. i wasnâ€™t coughing and didnâ€™t have a fever so urgent care wouldnâ€™t see me. called again and dr phone telemedicine call - he assured me that iâ€™m not in emergency mode yet. said only concerned if my fever comes back and wonâ€™t break with tylenol. frustrating. i somehow slept.

3rd - couldnâ€™t leave the bed. chills, sweats. sore all over. winded just getting up to pee. couldnâ€™t shower for a few days just lightheaded. it was the worst. i just tried so hard to sleep. i finally did. i hadnâ€™t had an appetite in days. i felt weak. heart pounding in my chest. i had a burning feeling in my chest..  i could not try the stairs to get to the kitchen. i got winded just getting up to pew. 

4th - 6th - the weekend was a blur. my husband force fed me and i drank lots of water. i started to feel better. i could rest with only minor shortness of breath. i started to have an appetite. my diarrhea and cramps went away. all that was left was sob and increased heart rate. monday the 6th, i felt good enough to go walk the dog up and down the street. didnâ€™t get winded. 

7th - i was feeling better. i wanted to eat everything. i did a meditation/yoga youtube video and felt pretty good. got winded but it felt like i was finally breathing into part of my lungs that was not available to me for the past few weeks. i had some gastro cramps and loose stool. i could tell it was still lingering. heart rate picked up again on the 8th. all by itself. it was a sign of things to come.

8th - wtf did i do wrong. worst day. possibly the worst iâ€™ve ever felt in my entire life. i was floored. i woke up at 6am, almost gasping. my husband woke up and sleep talking says â€œwhereâ€™s your air?â€ we both woke up and realized i may have not been really breathing right. i donâ€™t have and never have experienced sleep apnea but it sounded like that. fever had come during the night and i got tylenol fast. it never went over 101. temp got normal in like 2 hours. my heart rate was crazy. felt my heart in my throat basically. this warm kind of pain in my chest. sweating like crazy and still shivering. my feet were frozen! went through like 6 pairs of socks as i sweated through them. my breath was the shortest it has been this whole time. i did breathing exercises and my body just would not get a full breath. it basically felt the same as a little less than a week ago. was this a 3rd wave? i tried and finally went to sleep. tried resting as much as possible. i still never felt like i needed to go to the er. i knew i could still breath, even if it sucked. i knew i didnâ€™t have a fever... so i felt like (along with doctors consultation) i had to stay home and fight it out. 

9-10th - my heart rate has been settling down. with it, my breathing has improved. rest and relaxation is still hard to get. i lost my appetite again.. i have to basically force feed myself. iâ€™ll chew and chew until iâ€™m kinda forced to swallow. my body is not interested. iâ€™m so sore. i feel like i just had a major full body deep tissue massage. but not in the good way. i keep doing breathing exercises and try to get the air as deep in my lungs as possible. i feel it making a difference. i can start to sleep comfortably without the sob. 

11-14th - today! i feel pretty good. cautiously optimistic. iâ€™ve felt good before and been floored with another â€œwaveâ€... but my heart rate is chilling out. my shortness of breath is still there, but not so apparent anymore. my gastro issues are still kind if there. minor lose stool once a day. i have been able to walk up and down the block a couple times these past few days. i definitely still get winded if i do any cardio things... even running up the stairs is a no-no right now.  iâ€™m going to bed tonight without any concerns of my health. the little stuff i still feel, i think itâ€™s just going to take a lot of time. any inflammation that messed with my body will take time to heal. my body craves rest and food. i want to eat everything in the house. iâ€™m also completely able to nap for multiple hours finally. 

â€”â€”-


i hope your recovery comes fast. i surely wasnâ€™t expecting to be dealing with this for nearly a month. and iâ€™m guessing iâ€™ll be healing for months to come. 

good luck out there.

g1bcwk,2020-04-14 14:49:00 UTC,"i am presumed positive as my father in law (who lives in the same house) was diagnosed as positive over telemedicine - we aren't sick enough for tests.    we're in nyc and everyone in the house is able to work from home.  wanted to give a day by day of myself, as well as my fil and my husbands symptoms:

fil - mid 70's, average weight/height, non-smoker, diabetic:  been sick for around 2.5 weeks, starting around march 27th.    days 1-3 - achey, exhausted (sleeping all day), fever ranging up to 101, and confusion.  symptoms continue, he is diagnosed with a uti (telemedicine), takes antibiotics days 3-7, but confusion, exhaustion, lack of appetite all worsen.  fever is managed with acetaminophen.  day 8 - 2nd telemedicine appointment, doctor believes he has covid-19, and prescribes hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.  day 8-15 (today, last day antibiotics) - no fever for about a week now, much better appetite, energy, much less confusion.  he never developed a cough.

husband - early 30s, average weight/height, non-smoker, no co-morbitities:  symptoms for a week, starting on april 1. on and off cough, low grade fever on days 3-4.  some chest soreness.  day 5- telemedicine diagnosed him with bronchitis, prescribed an albuterol inhaler and benzonatate.  i was surprised that they didn't say he was presumed covid-19, since his father had been diagnosed at this time.  he is now on day 12, less albuterol and benzonatate each day.  still coughing on and off but chest doesn't hurt anymore.  he has some lingering tiredness and aches.

myself - late 20s, average weight/height (had been working out daily before symptoms started), non-smoker, no co-morbidities.

day 1 - (april 2nd):  feel out of it at night, don't feel like participating in my friend's zoom session but power through.

day 2 - diarrhea at night, followed by chest and stomach burning all night.  felt like heartburn but more throughout my entire chest and more painful than usual heartburn.

day 3- no symptoms

day 4 - realize i have no sense of smell or taste.  i was congested, and thought it might be a normal cold.

day 5/6 - same as day 4, feel exhausted while cooking, need to take breaks and sit for a bit.  realize that nose isn't stuffy, but can't smell any of the garlic i am adding to my meal.  inside of nose and deep sinuses feel like they have been burnt, or like i inhaled water up into my nose.

day 7 - wake up with a sore throat, other symptoms are the same.  have a headache at nigh

day 8 - taste is slightly coming back - but not smell.  accidentally take a sip of sour milk because i couldn't smell it, it tasted bitter and disgusting but not ""sour.""  had a headache at night and slight body aches.  also had dizzy spells.  this was also the only day that i had a cough on and off throughout the day, and it was worse at night.

day 9 - taste and smell continues to improve, but legs ache like i worked out hard.  enough to keep me up, but went away with tylenol.  dizzy spells continued, but not as bad as the previous day.

day 10 - very lazy day, nap on and off, legs hurt at night

day 11 - smell/taste at about 50%, still have burning sinus feeling, lingering tiredness.  also develop a giant cold sore - not sure if this has something to do with my immune response. 

day 12 - feel better, more energy, can focus on work, but have a weird episode of chest tightness (no cough, and can still take deep breaths).

also - had stomach problems (diarrhea, nausea) on and off, sore throat on some mornings (feels like post -nasal drip).  days 5-10 had general malaise, couldn't focus on work, took lots of naps, basically, the entire week is blurry.    although husband had the cough, our consensus is that i felt worse than he did.

husband and i have been taking probiotics, vitamin d, and vitamin c since the middle of march.  we also have been doing some deep breathing exercises (i also do them for anxiety).

tl;dr:  3 people in the same house, one telemed diagnosed as positive, two presumed positive.  all different, relatively mild symptoms.",$$$tightness$$$energy$$$nasal$$$grade fever$$$legs$$$smell$$$burning$$$fever$$$diarrhea$$$burning$$$nose$$$energy$$$take deep breaths$$$focus$$$headache$$$appetite$$$spells$$$something$$$but$$$sense$$$but$$$exhaustion$$$cough$$$breaks$$$legs$$$nose$$$nose$$$away$$$taste$$$achey$$$dizzy$$$taste$$$smell$$$cough$$$but$$$fever$$$dizzy$$$but$$$confusion$$$coughing$$$taste$$$appetite$$$diarrhea$$$anxiety$$$thought$$$throat$$$confusion$$$tiredness$$$cough$$$breathing$$$sinuses$$$throat$$$confusion$$$focus$$$cough$$$smell$$$before$$$fever$$$smell$$$but$$$but$$$but$$$stomach$$$tiredness$$$sinus$$$heartburn$$$but$$$taste$$$mid$$$but$$$smell$$$low grade fever$$$take deep breaths$$$soreness$$$heartburn$$$but$$$sleeping$$$fever$$$spells$$$smell$$$headache$$$tasted$$$cough$$$stomach$$$painful$$$nausea$$$but$$$,"$$$Chest tightness$$$Fatigue$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Anosmia$$$Chest pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Chest pain$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Fatigue$$$Dyspnea$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Headache$$$Loss of appetite$$$Hot Flush$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Fatigue$$$Ageusia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Ageusia$$$Anosmia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Cough$$$Ageusia$$$Loss of appetite$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Cough$$$Anosmia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Fatigue$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Chest pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Ageusia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Chest pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Hot Flush$$$Anosmia$$$Headache$$$Ageusia$$$Cough$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Chest pain$$$Nausea$$$Pyrexia$$$",$$$C0235710$$$C0015672$$$C1260880$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0003126$$$C0008031$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0008031$$$C1260880$$$C0015672$$$C0013404$$$C0012833$$$C0018681$$$C0232462$$$C0600142$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0741585$$$C1260880$$$C1260880$$$C0015672$$$C2364111$$$C0741585$$$C0012833$$$C2364111$$$C0003126$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C0010200$$$C2364111$$$C0232462$$$C0011991$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0012833$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0948596$$$C2363731$$$C0012833$$$C0012833$$$C0010200$$$C0003126$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0015672$$$C0948596$$$C0008031$$$C0015967$$$C2364111$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0741585$$$C0008031$$$C0015967$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0600142$$$C0003126$$$C0018681$$$C2364111$$$C0010200$$$C0011991$$$C0008031$$$C0027497$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
g1bmyi,2020-04-14 15:04:00 UTC,"hi there, i have been sick since about march 15th. i tested positive on march 24th. 

like many people, this has been a roller-coaster for me.  i am, at this point, no longer febrile and i have my taste and smell back (although not at full force). every morning i wake up terrified that i'm going to back slide since my recovery has been so up and down. 

lately, despite feeling pretty well, i have had terrible heartburn and what feels like something caught in my throat. it burns when i swallow and is very uncomfortable. i have been treating this with tums but it makes eating unappealing. 

i remain slightly fatigued and foggy -- my memory and ability to focus have suffered through this. just wondering if anyone else is experiencing heartburn or what feels like heartburn. i have an oximeter and my blood oxygen level seems fine. i still have a slight although productive cough but it's not crazy. no headache any more, thank god, and as i said, no fever. thanks all, be well!",$$$fever$$$cough$$$but$$$focus$$$something$$$heartburn$$$heartburn$$$heartburn$$$throat$$$memory$$$fatigued$$$productive cough$$$but$$$headache$$$smell$$$foggy$$$taste$$$,$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Chest tightness$$$Chest pain$$$Chest pain$$$Chest pain$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Headache$$$Anosmia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Ageusia$$$,$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C0235710$$$C0008031$$$C0008031$$$C0008031$$$C2363731$$$C0012833$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C0003126$$$C0012833$$$C2364111$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
g1bsnt,2020-04-14 15:12:00 UTC,"hi everyone, just wanted to introduce myself and compare notes.

started out with congestion and mild body aches... felt a lot like a cold.

day 6 the nausea kicked in, and my bp and heart rate felt a little irregular. that was scary.

it's been on and off with those two symptoms ever since. no fevers, no cough, no real sob, maybe very mild.

taking tylenol and mucinex here and there, and melatonin every night at sunset to help with sleep. 

the worst part for me is the anxiety. you don't know what's coming. when it worsens you can't help but wonder if it's gonna become a horror show. and i'm sharing a bathroom so i'm worried i'll spread it.

but as it is right now, i'm finding it manageable. watching netflix and taking phone calls from concerned people mostly. trying to stay optimistic.",$$$sob$$$but$$$but$$$nausea$$$fevers$$$heart rate$$$cough$$$worried$$$sleep$$$anxiety$$$,"$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Nausea$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Cough$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$",$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0027497$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0010200$$$C1832070$$$C0917801$$$C1832070$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

this past saturday (4/11) had diarrhea for an hour or two, was bloated and gassy, but i brushed it off. for a few days i'd been having headaches, figured it was sinus/allergy related because it's been raining a lot around her, whatever.

early monday morning wake up freezing. put on more clothes, go to sleep, wake up drenched in weat. fever of 101.1.

exhausted most of the day, just feel grossly fatigued. get to bed early that night, wake up at 3am with a fever of 102.3. take tylenol, put a wet rag on my face, ect.

fell asleep again and woke up at 8am drenched in sweat, fever seemed to have broke.

today i've been exhausted and the fever comes and goes. also congested- no snot, but hard time breathing through my nose. and i had some heart palpation earlier, but that was when my fever was really high (101) and also i have anxiety so trying to look on the bright side here.

my brother lives in the same house as me and has brain cancer so i'm beyond stressed. been locked in my room these past few days and quite bored. i take tylenol when the fever gets over 101, and i took some motrin 3 hours later because fever was still over 100.

i have anxiety and this isn't fun. i mean, i've had flu/strep that felt worse, but i also have ocd and so i just keep reading articles and i worry day 7 of the disease will come and i will go into respiratory distress and die.

g1eqm8,2020-04-14 17:53:00 UTC,"iâ€™ve been dealing with covid the last week or so and iâ€™m finally feeling a lot better so i thought iâ€™d share some home remedies that helped. 

 for reference, iâ€™m a 29 y/o female, i live in nyc and i had: 
loss of smell/taste, chest pain/pressure, body aches, diarrhea, chills, headache/lightheadedness, nausea/ vomiting (1x), coughing, no fever

today is day 8 and i feel pretty good.

+ i started with this tea my mom told me about

water,
2 navel orange peels,
half an onion,
3 cloves of garlic,
1 lime,
1 lemon,
2 oz of chopped ginger,

throw it all in a pot and let it simmer. it tastes like shit, not gonna lie. but iâ€™m convinced it was a game changer and iâ€™d have it at least 4 times a day. i was peeing every hour or so. itâ€™s important to stay hydrated so have lots of water too. 

+ for chest pains:  iâ€™d use a hot compress on my chest and this helped for some reason. i have a reusable one that iâ€™d just put in the microwave to heat up. a heating pad works too. i had read something about this virus disliking heat so i took that and ran with it. 

+ lots of hot showers and iâ€™d put on the heat in my bedroom at night.

+ iâ€™d boil water and put in two spoons of vicks, and do a steam with it twice a day (morning and night). stand over the pot, cover your head with a towel and breathe in and out slowly.

+ the headache was the most annoying symptom for me. it lasted so long. i donâ€™t really take medication, but i had to pop tylenol a few times. it helps with the body aches too. i popped advil early on in my symptoms before i knew it was covid but i stopped.

+ my only meals have been soup and white rice a few times a day as well as several oranges. (at least 3 a day) this was all i could stomach.

+ i took vitamin c and zinc pills. i struggled to sleep sometimes so i took natrol melatonin gummies. 

i didnâ€™t expect to get this thing. iâ€™ve been working from home since march 16th and only went to target twice and citymd. the doctor there diagnosed me with allergies. gave me a nasal spray and sent me on my way. 

i went to a different walk in clinic on sunday and was able to get tested. i got my results yesterday but i already knew it was covid. 

anyway, hope this helps. be safe everyone!",$$$before$$$headache$$$head$$$stand$$$but$$$but$$$headache$$$coughing$$$fever$$$vomiting$$$stomach$$$throw$$$smell$$$nausea$$$diarrhea$$$nasal$$$sleep$$$but$$$breathe$$$but$$$chills$$$something$$$lightheadedness$$$taste$$$thought$$$,$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Headache$$$Headache$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Headache$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Vomiting$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Vomiting$$$Anosmia$$$Nausea$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Chest tightness$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Ageusia$$$Pyrexia$$$,$$$C0013456$$$C0018681$$$C0018681$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0042963$$$C0011991$$$C0042963$$$C0003126$$$C0027497$$$C0011991$$$C1260880$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C0235710$$$C0012833$$$C2364111$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
g1nhhk,2020-04-15 03:47:00 UTC,"march 14th i was in nyc ( last day at work before lockdown) in middle of night of march 24  i woke up panting and with a high fever feeling like a truck hit me . felt like i fell off a building and someone beat my ribs and chest with a baseball bat, i felt bruised everywhere and it hurt to breathe. i couldnâ€™t sleep again. i was confused, i am thinking back i should have went to er but i think the fever really made me delusional i just sat in bed . not really saying anything to anyone.. i have a fever for two days straight then it went away. i couldnâ€™t get out of bed, i turned pale, and shaking like crazy. when i felt better (the shortness of breath and chest pain still lingered and it was very painful) i called every testing center and hospital and found no luck... i couldnâ€™t get tested . no doctors were accepting new patients and i didnâ€™t have hundreds of dollars just to see one plus all the lab results bills( no health insurance) so i just ride it out at home hoping i wouldnâ€™t die. i didnâ€™t get the test because itâ€™s was impossible but i am confident i am positive with my symptoms and knowing i never felt this sick before , also my job is in nyc and iâ€™m around hundreds of people for hours working very very close with clients for hours . 

i also immediately lost my smell and taste 100%. after fever went away the stomach pain came, diarrhea,nausea no vomitting, loss of appetite,extreme tiredness, headache, knee pain,joint pain,i still had trouble breathing, very painful like there were spikes in my airway .. everyday seemed to get better, so i stop panicking. beginning of april i feel good i got my smell and taste and appetite back. my stomach is better but still making a lot of noise , and only at nighttime is when my chest feels tight and hard to breathe . i usually just sleep it away then i feel ok again.

but tonight, i feel weird, i feel like that feeling you get right before you get really sick . headache,slight throat pain, shortness of breath, that weird headache...weird feeling in my mind and body... i even took a nap out of no where earlier today and i felt i couldnâ€™t wake up my body just put me to sleep instantly ( never happens with me iâ€™m not a napper and i donâ€™t fall asleep easily) i feel like this mild lingering pain that is waiting to burst into extreme pain.. i canâ€™t describe it but i can literally feel something in my body just waiting to attack.. 

i donâ€™t want to have the symptoms again.. itâ€™s very painful and scary as a lot of you may know..im scared if it will be worse this time. iâ€™m worried is this virus still inside and waiting to attack ? i thought i was getting better .. but i feel this virus is just staying for a very long time ..waiting...for the right time to attack again...when will this virus leave my body?? will it ever leave ?? i feel trapped . 


iâ€™m 24, iâ€™m in shape, the only thing is i have deathly food allergies to all nightshades plants/vegetables/foods so i do believe my immune system is not the strongest. 

my bf has this too but the only thing he experienced is one day of fever and loss of taste and smell.. no other symptoms.he is ok.",$$$breathe$$$throat$$$fever$$$sleep$$$smell$$$tiredness$$$but$$$breathing$$$taste$$$stomach$$$stomach$$$smell$$$away$$$before$$$tight$$$smell$$$worried$$$painful$$$painful$$$shaking$$$but$$$breath$$$fever$$$but$$$but$$$scared$$$fever$$$thought$$$but$$$everyday$$$came$$$something$$$taste$$$but$$$away$$$before$$$breath$$$away$$$sleep$$$painful$$$sleep$$$breathe$$$headache$$$taste$$$headache$$$fever$$$before$$$fever$$$appetite$$$ribs$$$but$$$,"$$$Dyspnea$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Anosmia$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Ageusia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Anosmia$$$Fatigue$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Anosmia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Chest pain$$$Chest pain$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$Chest tightness$$$Ageusia$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Chest pain$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Dyspnea$$$Headache$$$Ageusia$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Loss of appetite$$$Chest pain$$$Pyrexia$$$",$$$C0013404$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0917801$$$C0003126$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C2364111$$$C0011991$$$C0011991$$$C0003126$$$C0015672$$$C0013456$$$C0235710$$$C0003126$$$C1832070$$$C0008031$$$C0008031$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0235710$$$C2364111$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0013456$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0917801$$$C0008031$$$C0917801$$$C0013404$$$C0018681$$$C2364111$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0232462$$$C0008031$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

after first week i went into see my doc. i had no other symptoms. not even allergy symptoms with pollen hitting us hard. send me home. 

finally 3 weeks of looking for a place to test i found a clinic that would take you if you have a fever. i had wanted to go in cause i though nah it must be something else. nope you either test for covid-19 or go somewhere else. 

i was having a lot of joint and muscle pain in my hips and knees. i am flexible by nature and this was wayyyy out of the norm for me. also my eyes were red and hot and irritated in the morning like iâ€™d been on a 3 days bender. 

so drive through, tuesday april 7th was earliest i could get. i got the call on saturday april 11th that i am positive. ðÿ¦ they said stay home and the health department would call me in 24 hours. 

no call from the health department. i called them and they said they are running behind.

g22maf,2020-04-15 18:46:00 UTC,"well, i got my results about two hours ago. iâ€™ve had mild symptoms the whole way through - mild lung irritation, no real cough to speak of, mild fever that is gone now, headaches that passed.

i had a feeling something was wrong on the first day of symptoms. it wasnâ€™t bad, but it was different. i talked to my doctor who assured me it was unlikely that i had it. i had just changed bp medications to a calcium channel blocker, and it could have been that. a few days later, i got tested. five days since then, and it came back positive.

iâ€™m posting here for one reason. when it came to prevention, iâ€™ve done everything right. i have worn a mask since before my state was in a state of emergency, a good one. i had stayed out of grocery stores, drug stores, etc. i have wiped down everything that has come into my home with bleach, wipes, etc. iâ€™ve washed my hands and every surface continuously for a month. i still got it, somehow. some small break in the armor, and it got it.

this isnâ€™t a fear monger if post. we all know how infectious this is. this is post to let you know that, if you have done all you can to prevent getting this infection, and you get it anyway, itâ€™s okay. itâ€™s not a failing. you did your best. you tried so hard.

getting sick is not defeat. you did your bit. now, itâ€™s time to hunker down, relax, and focus on getting healthy, knowing that you played your part the best you could.

day 11 update: the mild fever has returned. still feel about the same. iâ€™ll check in again, if there is a change.

day 12 update: the fever was off and on a bit last night. looks like my body is still trying to fight this thing. today, my lungs are worse. i can feel some blockage in them. no real cough yet, but i can feel how this might turn into one.

day 13 update: feeling better today, but not pushing it. slept in, and then sat on the couch a bit. did some light cooking, but i stopped when i felt a little tired. all in all, a good day. still some lung congestion that came on yesterday, but certainly less. weâ€™ll see what tomorrow brings.

day 14 update: might have pushed it a bit hard yesterday, but i was still mostly okay today. a tickle in my lungs compared with the recent sludginess. i had a pang if anxiety today, but thatâ€™s mostly because iâ€™ve been reading about people who didnâ€™t take their healing seriously enough and started being active before they had fully killed off the virus. their symptoms came back. let that be a warning to all of us.

day 15 update: better still, today. i feel much as i did on day 1, when all of this seemed so unlikely. the tickle in the chest, but little else. i am taking some time off work to really rest and recuperate. although i will have to start working again before long, i have given myself the goal of being very careful and restful through the second week of may so that i can be sure my body has been given enough time to throw this off. my county health department says that i need to test negative before i am allowed to leave my home. so, i aim to do that toward the beginning of next week.

day 16 update: much the same as yesterday. still getting better. taking it slow.

day 17 update: other than a terrible panic attack, i have been doing pretty well. my lungs are really close to being back to normal. iâ€™m so hopeful, but also extremely careful.

day 18 update: i believe my symptoms are gone. i am going to push for a test next week as requested by the county health department. hopefully it will show that i am negative. i will still maintain my careful rest and slow progression toward normalcy.

day 19 update: well, i had hoped i was done with this, but apparently not. had a rough day today. not the worse iâ€™ve had, but certainly worse than yesterday. no fever, but felt sick and had congestion in my right chest. i also had some sinus trouble. i have done everything right, as far as i know. this may just be how it goes. iâ€™m hoping for a better day tomorrow.

day 20 update: i slept for about 12 hours and felt much better. i spent most of the day symptom-free, with only a twinge if some leftover muck in my lungs. always progressing.

day 21 update: i did much better today, but i have had terrible gi pain due to gas and inflammation. nothing unmanageable, but anyone who has had bad stuck gas pains know that it can be occasionally excruciating.

day 22 update: good news: my lungs are right as rain. bad news: my gut has not changed. terrible pain like trapped gas. definitely inflammation in there. also, my fever has returned, 99.0-99.6. my heart rate has increased with my fever, 110-120bpm. i am staying hydrated and trying to stay optimistic. this whole process has been brutal. i broke down earlier, fearing what may happen to me and how the fever has come back. i wept until i just couldnâ€™t anymore. i am so afraid, but that doesnâ€™t stop me from being hopeful. i may not know what i have in store tomorrow, but i have fought hard to get to day 22. i will continue to fight to get to 23, 24, 25, 50, 100, and 365. i may lose the fight unexpectedly, as any of us might, but i will keep fighting nonetheless. i will not go gently.

day 23 update: today was better. my fever broke in the night, and it woke me up, as i began sweating under all my covers. the gi pain has not gone away entirely, but it is easier to manage today than it was yesterday. i attempted to make cookies today, nothing very taxing, as i was just using a beater. the effort of it cost me a great deal, though. i started sweating terribly and had to take off my shirt and lie down. my partner placed an ice back on my back, and i began to feel better. all the more evidence that effort is an enemy until we are free of this virus. iâ€™ve been reading more about how this virus attacks the endothelial cells rather than just attacking the lungs. it makes sense, as the worst symptoms iâ€™ve had revolves around my heart. i hope you all are doing okay. i am still here, and i have not given up hope.",$$$fever$$$gi$$$but$$$before$$$fever$$$focus$$$but$$$sweating$$$came$$$but$$$but$$$slept$$$whole$$$fever$$$but$$$reading$$$but$$$but$$$cough$$$but$$$panic attack$$$but$$$something$$$fever$$$cough$$$came$$$but$$$whole$$$headaches$$$inflammation$$$but$$$but$$$throw$$$gi$$$panic attack$$$anxiety$$$state$$$slept$$$fever$$$unmanageable$$$but$$$came$$$reading$$$sense$$$fever$$$goes$$$but$$$but$$$came$$$but$$$fever$$$fever$$$panic$$$before$$$heart rate$$$inflammation$$$state$$$before$$$away$$$before$$$sinus$$$tired$$$but$$$sweating$$$but$$$,"$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Pyrexia$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Headache$$$other$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Vomiting$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Palpitations$$$other$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Fatigue$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Pyrexia$$$",$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C0020458$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0917801$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0018681$$$C0000000$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0042963$$$C0011991$$$C1832070$$$C1832070$$$C0012833$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0013456$$$C0030252$$$C0000000$$$C0012833$$$C0013456$$$C0015672$$$C0013456$$$C0948596$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0020458$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

g253ju,2020-04-15 21:09:00 UTC,"i'm a  22 year old college student. i live alone, my parents are deceased, i take the city bus everywhere and i have to walk to the store to buy food and water to survive even tho i have the virus. this is why it keeps spreading. 

i got the virus around february 26th. the 1st week wasn't so bad, felt weak, fatigue, sore throat, lung breathing issues, felt like there was something stuck in my left lung, then gradually every 24 hours i would feel no symptoms and be okay as long as i remained indoors. 

after 24 hours of no symptoms i would get all of them back plus a new symptom added on top of those such as coughing, fever, body aches(these were the worst symptoms) and also runny nose. the breaking point was being unable to breathe and i went to the hospital in the ambulance. 

after 3 trips to the hospital i was given a slap on the wrist and some benadryl. the doctors swore they were out of covid 19 test and said id have to  get it from some location. (obviously not going all the way out there when i feel unable to walk)i have stay well healthcare and you can't get any medication from walgreens, publix or cvs,  because this insurance is completely fucking useless. so i haven't been able to get any medication at all. i cant afford anything, i dont have any money or foodstamps. i'm surviving off my last paycheck which is nearly gone because i am a busser at a restaurant that closed down.

between feeling like im dying and can't pay my rent or eat i have no support from anyone. i dont want to tell my friends i have the virus because i dont want to be treated badly. i haven't been around anyone but i'm forced to take the bus and go into the store to buy food. i cant even buy toilet paper because there is none. 

i bought 24 pack of water and during the week i would drink water and put the rest of the water i didnt finish next to my bed. the next morning i would drink that water. after not losing any symptoms i realized the saliva on the bottles were just bacteria just nesting overnight. 

after 4 weeks the symptoms went away. and i was so paranoid to leave the house in fear of getting the virus again. 

but i ran out of food and water again. that was 4 days ago. even wearing gloves and trying to not touch anything on the bus or sit down and wash all the food from the store i got the virus again and all these symptoms are coming back.  

this shit never ends. 

i am losing my mind i litterly just can't take this anymore. i'm so tired and weak i just don't know what to do anymore.  i see people not wearing mask or gloves and they are virus free and i am just getting it non stop after protecting myself. 

my cough is so bad i can't hardly breathe. i know going to the hospital again is pointless. they sent me a bill for 1600$and my insurance sent me a denial form of payment because i didnt authorize a request for paramedic transport lmaooooo. i was unable to breathe and i feel like im dying.

you can't win in this system. its made to get rid of the people that are expandable.  i don't even know what to say anymore.

no matter who i try to call they wont answer. 

cvs wont answer because high call volumes
my stay well insurance wont answer after 1 hour on a hold
 food stamps wont answer 
unemployment is taking forever to get to the next process because every one is also signing up. 

this is just horrible.  i don't know wtf im supposed to do other than pray and try to sleep and shower all day.

3/22 initial mild symptoms, 3/28 loss of taste & smell, 3/31 positive pcr test, 4/4 last symptoms. lucky to have been one of the mild cases, and a quick recovery. but am i ok to be around others?!!?!

last week i started hearing about a local lab(arcpoint labs, richmond, ca)  offering a $125 antibody test. it's a test from china, heavily marked up and not fda approved but allowed.  a few friends rushed to try it and were all negative so i decided to give it a shot to help provide a data point. the woman who checked me in wore a lab coat that said frank on it.  it wasn't like other labs or medical offices i've been to, just didn't have a professional vibe. the test was quick and easy, finger prick and wait ten minutes. 

this was the result:

[https://imgur.com/a/czedg0w](https://imgur.com/a/czedg0w)

it apparently says i don't have a current infection and have developed the longer term antibodies. the other lab technician(?) seemed generally surprised at the results, apparently only 1% of the tests have come back positive. he seemed even more confused about my nonchalant attitude. 'ok thanks, see ya later'. i wouldn't recommend this test really, there are better ones coming in the next few weeks (abbott, stanford, etc) that have much higher efficacy rates.  more info on the specific lab here:

really looking forward to more clarity on this next stage, immunity, etc. being one of the earlier cases here, theres not a whole lot of social protocol yet. some friends want to hug me and others act like if i look at them they will get infected.",$$$taste$$$whole$$$smell$$$but$$$look$$$but$$$,$$$Ageusia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$,$$$C2364111$$$C0741585$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

while a lot of people around me have been beyond supportive and helpful during this time, others seem to minimise it or even completely ignore it. i can't tell if they don't believe how bad it can be or if they just don't care. some seemed concerned to begin with, then stopped giving a shit when i thought i was better, then it came back, then i felt better again, then it came back again...

i'm not sure what i expected of them, but when these same people go on to complain about being bored at home all the time (while still healthy and able to work remotely), liken their current situation to being a prisoner of war, and make reductive statements about how government policy is disproportionately protecting the well-being of a few over-70's... well, it makes me feel like shit.

excuse typos, i have a shake. 

still having fevers and difficulty breathing. throat feels swollen and thick.

i am 3 days in on some scary neurological symptoms. i have an involuntary tremor. tremor is strongest in hands, arms, shoulders, neck and head. focusing hands to do detailed things like typing is exhausting and makes it harder to breathe.

near constant dizziness and nausea. baseline is tolerable but episodes of strong dizziness and nausea are very scary. 

i cannot walk straight and when i'm holding things trying to do something with my hands i often drop things or accidentally toss them.

i have been through er twice and was never admitted to hospital. even when i was coughing up blood and my breathing sounded like a pot of boiling water in a metal tube.

g31e4j,2020-04-17 08:50:00 UTC,"hi! this is kind of long so if you donâ€™t want to read it all, my main question is: how long did it take you to recover, what were your symptoms when you had it, and do you have any residual symptoms post recovery?


my dad (53 y/o) my siblings (21 and 22), and i (24) all have covid and are all isolating in our own bedrooms. my mom (59) somehow has not caught it yet (which i am thankful for). my dad and i got it first on march 25. my two younger siblings got it a week later and seem to still be struggling, but have a more mild case than my dad and i.

we have all experienced different symptoms and different levels of severity of each symptom. since we are all isolating in separate rooms of the house, i have not seen any of them in 24 days so i donâ€™t know specifics of their symptoms, only what they have shared via text. 

my biggest concerns right now are 
-my heart rate (which is anywhere from 67-110 when laying down, and over 120 when standing. it even sometimes reaches 170+).
-my oxygen levels. initially i was struggling with breathing and chest pressure/fullness much more. this past week i have been having an imperfect, but much easier, time breathing. however, sometimes my oxygen levels will still dip into the 80s even though i am not feeling much of a struggle for air anymore. 
-i also have seasonal asthma from tree pollen that starts about this time of year so iâ€™m concerned as to if that will worsen my condition when i feel like i am making some (very gradual) improvements
-last week i had a sharp pain in my chest by my heart. it seems to not be present anymore, but if anyone knows what that may have been please share. 

my dads biggest concern right now is a pressure in his chest that sounds much more intense than mine. i think by this point his other symptoms are uncomfortable, but not scary. 

has anyone here had similar severity/types of symptoms, or symptoms for over/around 24 days as well, and recovered?

if so, please share how long it took you to recover, and what your primary symptoms were. additionally, please share if you continued to experience a cough, breathing difficulties, chest pressure, low grade fever, fatigue, or a high heart rate, after recovery and how long any residual post recovery symptoms have lasted for.

g385re,2020-04-17 14:58:00 UTC,"just as it says on the tin. i was tested for covid19 on april 2, after struggling with the symptoms at home for a week and a half. the result came back positive 24 hours later and i was picked up by an ambulance and taken to the hospital to be admitted on the night between april 3 and 4 (my country is still admitting all positive cases in hospital). was discharged on april 13, after two negative rt-pcr tests in a row.

here's the problem, though. almost all of my symptoms from the first week of infection:

- pain at the back of the skull
- weakness and dizziness
- dehydration
- constant urination if i drink even a small amount of liquid (urinated over *eighteen times* today)
- muscle pain
- nerve pain in arms
- very foul smelling sweat
- soft, sun-yellow, foul smelling stools
- constant feeling of knot in throat and difficulty swallowing

are back with a goddamn vengeance and i feel worse than ever, even with those two negative tests. the only things i'm missing from three weeks ago are the explosive diarrhea and the night sweats that soak the sheets (and at this rate they'll come back in due time, i'm sure).

this is a post i made here at the end of march, before i was confirmed positive:

https://www.reddit.com/r/covid19positive/comments/foz9go/anyone_had_explosive_diarrhea_and_constant

**even after treatment (five days on hcq) and two consecutive negative tests, this virus is still present in my system and fucking me up.** right now i'm fighting the constant choking feeling in my throat, as if the pharynx wants to close up (at one point in late march i spent a sleepless night when i became totally unable to swallow anymore. to swallow my own saliva, i'd have to gather a ton of it, then tip my head back and struggle).

my breathing itself is fine (never had either shortness of breath or loss of taste and smell, not for a moment) and i've never really had a fever either. spo2 values steady at 97%, but the rest of me feels utterly wrecked. in particular, i feel like i can't keep up with how much fluid my kidneys are pumping out and i'm constantly dehydrated, no matter how many rehydration salts or vitamin drinks or tea or plain water i chug down. i just piss more and i don't know how long my kidneys will last under these conditions.

in hospital i wasn't taken seriously because i didn't have pulmonary symptoms, my gi symptoms and massive urination were either ignored or blamed on something else. hence just five days on hcq, with my file noting ""patient became asymptomatic"". i did improve, but my gi issues and nerve pain never disappeared, just lessened, but they were ignored when i reported them.

two takeaways here:

**- be prepared for two negatives to not necessarily mean this thing is gone** (now i understand what probably happened in south korea with those ""reinfection"" cases. it's not reinfection, the viral load goes down likely due to immune response and then this thing surges again)

**-be prepared to not even be believed if you don't have pulmonary symptoms**

i don't know what to do, on my end. i'm feeling worse and worse and i genuinely can't keep up with the fluid loss (fell down today when going to the bathroom, likely due to the electrolyte imbalance). my kidneys themselves are okay for now, i don't have any sort of uti, no blood or protein in the urine (they did check for this in the hospital, at least). it's just something about this infection that tries to wring all the water from my body.",$$$taste$$$dehydration$$$fever$$$weakness$$$something$$$head$$$breath$$$throat$$$diarrhea$$$before$$$gi$$$arms$$$came$$$swallowing$$$dizziness$$$something$$$but$$$smell$$$sweat$$$gi$$$breathing$$$but$$$throat$$$muscle$$$choking$$$dehydrated$$$goes$$$night sweats$$$sweats$$$but$$$sleepless$$$,$$$Ageusia$$$Dehydration$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Chest tightness$$$Headache$$$Dyspnea$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Cough$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Myalgia$$$Dyspnea$$$Dehydration$$$Palpitations$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Pyrexia$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$,$$$C2364111$$$C0011175$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0235710$$$C0018681$$$C0013404$$$C2363731$$$C0011991$$$C0013456$$$C0011991$$$C0741585$$$C0010200$$$C2363731$$$C0012833$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0020458$$$C0011991$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0231528$$$C0013404$$$C0011175$$$C0030252$$$C0020458$$$C0020458$$$C0015967$$$C0917801$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

i have been presumed positive and am.on week three now.  they finally set up a drive up testing site in the area via quest diagnostics so i was able to go get tested today - i was denied testing before because i wasn't a healthcare worker or first responder and didn't need to be hospitalized.

so i've been isolating alone in my apartment and the isolation and being sick is just making me horribly scared.

i'm now on my third wave of whatever this is.  i've experienced nausea, diarrhea, headache, sinus congestion, runny nose, chills, chest congestion, a constant almost drowning/wet lung feeling, shortness of breath, a bit of a dry cough, heart palpations, and the latest symptom of dizzy spells.

i've been taking mucinex, pepto bismul, tylenol, and an albuterol inhaler.  melatonin to sleep at night.  klonopin from my therapist when i panic.

it's been three weeks and the fact that i keep getting waves and symptoms i thought were gone come back i'm starting to really worry.  i think about people in the hospital and if going to the hospital means inevitably a ventilator or death.  i'm just... this constant state of fear.

please someone give me some good news or hope.  anything i can ground myself with.  i keep reminding myself that yes its been 3 weeks, but that means i'm at least 3 weeks through it now.

for reference i'm 36, female, obese, but no other real underlying conditions.  the worst of the lung congestion and shortness of breath seems to be gone, though given the waves and return of symptoms i don't even know if that's true.

today we got the anti-body blood test in california. she tested negative across the board. and i tested posted for both igm and igg which seems to indicate according to the test that i am both still contagious and also have some level of immunity. 

these are pretty confusing results for a couple reasons. one i think without a doubt i got sick from my fiance and even if i didn't, i'm not sure how she wouldn't have got it from me during quarantine. also if i was exposed over a month ago it's hard to imagine i would still be contagious.

cue 5 hours of my body cleaning everything ingested. it was 8 hours later so it was a deep dive for a 1.2 inch tbone. first time in my life shitting and puking in the bath simultaneously.

it was violent, completist, and theatrical. i shat my pyjamas, for fuck sake. i lay on a pile of laundry on the bathroom floor between expletions.

so far itâ€™s like an annoying grouping of random symptoms that come and go. some moments i feel okay, others blah, sometimes pretty icky. lots of fatigue in general. 

the ear pain has been the worst for me. 

iâ€™m on day 11-ish. not sure when the â€˜youâ€™re likely not to get worseâ€™ point is, but just keeping fingers crossed i stay on mild end.

editing to add my symptoms: 

day 1-3: severe nausea , vomited twice total


day 3-4:  extreme fatigue and body aches


day 4 evening: sore throat, mild cough, ear pain, feeling cold (not typical chills)


day 5: called dr with same symptoms of days 3-4, got tested.  realized i couldnâ€™t smell anything. 

day6-8: ups and downs of days 3-5 symptoms. 


day 9: slight tightness in chest. no real breathing issues, dr gave me inhaler anyway. 


day 10-11: same symptoms, but slightly better. a little more energy. 

day 12-13: feeling pretty good. not perfect, but definitely better. cough is about non-existent, mostly lingering intermittent fatigue and a dry (not sore) throat. ear pain is more an ear-irritation now. iâ€™m just continuing to take it easy to hopefully avoid any resurgence of symptoms. 

day 14: felt completely normal again. woke up and felt great. 


the closest to a fever i had was 99.5. but mostly no fever at all. 



medications given by dr:

mucinex 

claritin

flonase

tylenol if needed (havenâ€™t taken) 

albuterol 

antibiotic in case ear pain is infection 


iâ€™m already in vitamin c, d, b12 injections, and calcium and was told to keep taking all.

o2 sats 97-99 the whole time so far.

right now it seems as if she just has a cold. iâ€™ve heard her mildly dry cough but her voice sounds like thereâ€™s mucus in there or just sounds a little sick. she can still function but itâ€™s only the beginning.

iâ€™m worried and sad that she might not be as mild as me. since this virus happens so fast i donâ€™t know what to expect. iâ€™m heartbroken that the next 2 weeks can go so severe and i shouldnâ€™t expect the best because it might not be the case since she has underlying conditions. iâ€™m so scared itâ€™s gonna take a turn for the worse. iâ€™m trying not to be pessimistic and hope for the best but i canâ€™t stop imagining something drastic. every time i hear her cough i literally break down.",$$$but$$$worried$$$cough$$$cough$$$scared$$$mucus$$$but$$$smell$$$but$$$voice$$$something$$$taste$$$cough$$$,"$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$other$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Ageusia$$$Cough$$$",$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C1832070$$$C0000000$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0235710$$$C2364111$$$C0010200$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
g4jp9u,2020-04-19 21:29:00 UTC,"last week was my first week back to work.  a few hours before i had to get ready i developed a terrible headache.

took 1300 mg of tylenol,  didn't touch the headache. took a nap for a few hours, felt worse when i awoke but it was too late to call out sick without risk of getting written up.

went to work.  even walking slowly and taking it slow, using my inhalers, struggled to breathe. 

left work after 1.5 hours.

was so exhausted and still couldn't breathe, so called out the next day.

the following 3 days i made it further into my shift, and on day 3 i managed to work a full 8 hours with lots of breathing exercises and going really slow.

i have ran out of sick time, as well as 80 hours of the emergency sick time granted by my employer. 

i had a tele visit with a covid19 specialist/doctor at the best hospital in the state, who said that there was absolutely nothing to be done for me, there is no further treatment for me, there is nothing for me to do except rest. 

i talked to the covid19 specialty triage line nurses who had no advice for me.  i talked to the health department who also said there is no treatment for me.

so this is just it i guess.  struggling to breath and having to take things reallllllly slow.

learn from my mistakes - if you think you're recovered, still don't do anything or work because it might be a false recovery. 

sorry if this has brought anyone bad news.  i just want everyone to know the truth.

g4k9hk,2020-04-19 22:08:00 UTC,"26m, just about finishing up my 14 day quarantine after testing positive. originally went to get tested after not being able to test/smell anything. symptoms started with tickle in throat and very mild <100 degree fever for two days. then came the not being able to taste/smell and at that point knew i had it. this lasted for about 2 days and after that everything was fine.

got the virus from my wife who was still working in nyc as an essential worker. i had been working at home for almost 2 weeks prior to any symptoms occurring and she was completely asymptomatic. it really is strange how this virus affects everyone differently. 

iâ€™ve been symptom free for over a week now. the worst part of it (for me) was not being able to smell (and hence taste) absolutely anything. because it was my sense of smell and not actually taste that i lost i could still kind of taste sour, sweet, and salty but the actual flavor of the things i was eating was non existent. about the only things that brought me joy to eat weâ€™re oranges, pretzels (kind of) and sweetened ice tea. my doctor told me the loss of smell/taste could last up to a month and honestly idk what i would have done if that was the case. being stuck inside, eating is really one of the only little bits of enjoyment i still have.

all in all, i was one of the lucky ones in that my symptoms were very mild and went away in only a few days. i do count myself lucky that i did have some sort of symptoms and went and got tested because my wife did not and she was still going into work. me getting tested possibly saved several lives by having her also be tested and quarantined after testing positive and her work enacted even stricter protocols afterwards. just wanted to share my story and stay safe out there!",$$$smell$$$fever$$$taste$$$throat$$$away$$$eat$$$taste$$$taste$$$smell$$$degree fever$$$taste$$$smell$$$came$$$smell$$$smell$$$sense$$$taste$$$but$$$,$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Ageusia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Fatigue$$$Loss of appetite$$$Ageusia$$$Ageusia$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Ageusia$$$Anosmia$$$Cough$$$Anosmia$$$Anosmia$$$Anosmia$$$Ageusia$$$Pyrexia$$$,$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C2364111$$$C2363731$$$C0015672$$$C0232462$$$C2364111$$$C2364111$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C2364111$$$C0003126$$$C0010200$$$C0003126$$$C0003126$$$C0003126$$$C2364111$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
g4ovi8,2020-04-20 04:14:00 UTC,"previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/covid19positive/comments/fykla4/29_days_keeps_coming_back/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

thought i'd do an update on myself with the intent of raising awareness of myself and others in the same situation. 

in my last post i expressed my concerned of a hsv/hiv like mechanism and potential infection of the cns/brain tissue. i can find lots of data to back up cns and brain infiltration but we still don't know enough to confirm the pathogensis of the virus in the long term. [that said, we know many viruses show a potential for brain infection and consequent neurological alterations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2782954/), so for now i've dropped my speculation of the virus laying dormant like hsv. 

[long term studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15860716/) of sars-cov1 survivors showed a significant reduction in functional ability and quality of life out of proportion to lung function impairment. i think it's safe to tentatively assume a similar prognosis.

given my symptoms and the response i received from my last post, it's likely the symptoms i'm suffering from would be attributed to *post viral fatigue syndrome*. at 6 months this could then become diagnosable as *chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis*

https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-cfs/

i have been through the severe pneumonia stage and now have assumed pulmonary scarring; doctor confirmed.

i am pleased to report a decrease in the severity of the 'flare ups' of symptoms although i'm far from being well. 

current symptoms: 

- nausea 
- mild confusion 
- brain fog
- lack of memory recall from the previous day(s)
- long term memory is more difficult to recall 
- mental and physical exhaustion 
- swaying when i walk and stand (balance issues)
- tinnitus 
- dream like state
- colours are attenuated 
- visual anomalies, spots/ stars (not hallucinations)
- slow reaction times 
- lingering headaches 
- chest is still really sore 
- out of breath through walking short distances 
- sleep issues 
- dissociation
- heart cramps, pain and palpitations 
- muscular pain
- nerve pain 
- joint pain 
- headaches 
- focus issues 
- weight loss - assumed muscular 
- sensitivity to light 

the neurological perception issues could be summarised to those without an insight as feeling similar in nature to being drunk, stoned or high on small amounts of ketamine without the good sensations brought on by those drugs. 

i'll walk around to do minor housework and it's like my brain will lag and switch off momentarily; a dream like stuttered perception. 

i'm able to look after myself but i have to take things slow. i couldn't return to running my business dealing with these issues at present; the physical and mental fatigue is beyond anything i've experienced before. fatigue doesn't do it justice, i'm wiped out from the moment i wake with no let up till i fall asleep.

sleep is non-refreshing, i wake exhausted. it would appear i'm having 3 hours of seemingly normal sleep and with a transition into 4 hours of unrestful tossing and turning that includes the most vivid dreams.

to reiterate, i'm not experiencing anxiety. anxiety isn't contributing to my symptoms. 

i'm taking no medication for any of the symptoms but i am supplementing my diet with multi vitamins and a plant based complete protein, protien powder. i do eat meat, i just prefer plant based supplements.

i was previously very healthy, i would work out 5 days a week with full body weight exercises plus light jogging. i ate very clean and counted calorie/macro intake. non smoker. 26m. very mild asthma that never held me back. if anything inhalers appeared to worsen the major lung issues; the aerosols seemed to irritate my lungs.

as we wait for an understanding from the medical community to materialise, i'm taking it day by day because that's all i can do at this time.

i would urge anyone in my position to keep a day by day health diary, it'll help you track your progression and in future it could help your care provider understand your illness to offer better treatment.

for example, i'm recording my symptoms, weight and sleep hours. i'm also scoring my health out of 10, with 0 being the worst of the early illness and 10 being my previous good health. for reference,  i'm back and forth between a 4 and a 5.

if anyone has a similar story, i encourage you to comment.

my inbox is also open for anyone looking to share mutual support and experiences.

g4p1z9,2020-04-20 04:30:00 UTC,"the other day i took a trip to the hospital because i was having bad chest pains and concerning symptoms such as: shallow breathing, and intense buzzing and tingling throughout my entire body, and very bad dizziness. i could barely speak or walk when it was at its worst. that whole week i had covid like symptoms (fever, sore throat, dry cough,  extreme tiredness), but when it reached its peak i had to go the er.  they asked me originally if i took any medication - so i told them i  took a low dose of an antidepressant for my general anxiety disorder. as soon as i told the nurse this, she left me alone in the room (barely checking on me) when i felt like i was going to collapse. when she came in, i pointed to my vitals with concern - she scoffed and said ""yeah, of  course,  your oxygen is low and your heart rate is 125 bpm. you are working yourself into a fit!"" i wasn't hyperventilating, i was just breathing more quickly because every breath i took was shallow. i tried to tell her i was nervous about the buzzing, the buzzing didn't happen after me being nervous. then the doctor came in and just said: ""you just had a panic attack you are fine, do you need us to hook you up with a therapist?"" i tried to explain to him i never had this bad of chest pain and uncontrollable shaking/tingling in my entire body and my vision blacking out from it. he just smiled and said ""yeah you might have  covid, stay home, get plenty of rest and remember to try your best not to panic!"" the thing is...i knew chest pain was a serious symptom of covid,  and i get panic attacks from time to time but never experience burning/stabbing chest pain like that and that weird bodily sensation. i begged the doctor to not discharge me and stay to look at my vitals. because when the nurse left me alone my oxygen saturation got to 76 - and it supposed to be 92 or higher! i wanted to show him how it fluctuated, but since the last reading said 92 ""i was fine"" i went home and the next day the burning got so so bad in my lungs. every time i would inhale even lightly i had sharp, stabbing pain, the dizziness got way worse i couldn't walk, i had a high fever, and genuinely felt like i was on my death bed. every time i exhaled there would be a noticeably loud crackling sound my boyfriend could even hear. i also started to cough up blood. i went to another er, and i chose to not mention my anxiety diagnosis and they took me so much more seriously. they decided to actually do detailed testing on me (blood tests, ct scan, urine  tests) not just the old fashioned x-ray and stethoscope. they found a concerning abnormality in my blood from a bacteria infection. they found my lungs were dangerously very filled with phlegm and fluid in the ct scan.  they showed me the picture and said it is very clear it is a bad  ""covid-19 bacteria induced pneumonia case"" just by seeing how blocked my lungs were i was so terrified. luckily, immediately after they instantly put me on very strong antibiotics through an iv to try to help me as soon as possible. they told me when that tingling happened, my body was reacting to the lack of oxygen from all the gunk in my lungs. they said it was pretty severe for my age, but they were going to do  what they could to help me. even now that i am on an inhaler and strong antibiotics i still have difficulty breathing (but i know that if i never went back to the hospital and listened to the other er that said i was just panicking, it could have been much much worse - i could have died) it makes me so sad how biased those doctors were towards my mental illness. but i just want to say to anyone with scary medical symptoms (who is not getting taken seriously by doctors due to your mental illness) please keep trying to get help. not all doctors will dismiss you. if you feel there is something genuinely wrong, don't stop looking for treatment until you get the help you need!!",$$$breathing$$$panic attack$$$sharp$$$panic$$$shallow breathing$$$burning$$$reading$$$dizziness$$$but$$$breathing$$$but$$$shaking$$$but$$$vision$$$but$$$fever$$$heart rate$$$panic$$$throat$$$phlegm$$$tiredness$$$breath$$$breathing$$$stabbing$$$cough$$$difficulty breathing$$$alone$$$nervous$$$fever$$$anxiety$$$came$$$pneumonia$$$alone$$$panic attacks$$$difficulty breathing$$$panic$$$stabbing$$$nervous$$$whole$$$look$$$burning$$$something$$$panic attack$$$dizziness$$$but$$$panic attacks$$$anxiety$$$came$$$cough$$$but$$$,"$$$Dyspnea$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Chest pain$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Dyspnea$$$Chest pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Visual impairment$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$Chest pain$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$other$$$Fatigue$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Dyspnea$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Chest pain$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Chest pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$",$$$C0013404$$$C1832070$$$C0008031$$$C1832070$$$C0013404$$$C0008031$$$C0013404$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C3665347$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C1832070$$$C2363731$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0008031$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0000000$$$C0015672$$$C1832070$$$C0013404$$$C1832070$$$C0008031$$$C1832070$$$C0741585$$$C0741585$$$C0008031$$$C0235710$$$C1832070$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

my name is sasha, i am from russia, and i am infected with coronavirus.â 

**note:** this is a huge wall of text, and if you don't feel like reading it, there's tl;dr at the end, and here are some pictures for you to check out: [https://imgur.com/a/hqr4beh](https://imgur.com/a/hqr4beh)

**edit 1:** i've updated this story to share the recent developments, please check out edit 1 at the very bottom, as well as the imgur gallery.

i've been ill for slightly more than 2 weeks already, and it seems (and i hope) that i am on my way to recovery. the only symptom i have right now is the loss of my sense of smell, and my sense of taste seems to be somewhat muted, so i hope none of the more serious symptoms will reemerge.

i have a few friends in the united states, and when i tell them how much attention and care i receive from our public healthcare system, on a daily basis, and completely for free, i notice this leaves them completely speechless. they encouraged me to document my story, saying it might be interesting for other people to learn about my personal experience here in moscow.

to clarify, i am not affiliated with any of the governments or medical organizations whatsoever - as you will see from my story, there a lot of things in our current system that i am unhappy about, and i will share all of my thoughts with you.

now, without further ado, let's get to the story itself.

# i have a bad feeling about this

my mom works at the hr department of a very big hospital in moscow. this hospital has many different wards, including a cardiology ward.

some time around the middle of march, the cardiology ward receives a new patient, who experiences a shortness of breath. this patient's doctor decided that that is caused by his heart condition, and prescribes him cardiological treatment. however, a week passes by, but his shortness of breath doesn't go away, yet with this kind of treatment it should have. and so the staff decides to test the patient for coronavirus - and, of course, the results are positive. immediately, the decision is made to quarantine the whole cardiology ward. doctors who were in contact with this patient were sent home.

very soon afterwards, there was a very similar situation in another ward, and by that point, it became clear that the hospital has quite a few coronavirus cases. some people proposed that they send non-medical staff home to work remotely, but the management decided that ""our hospital will not be working remotely.â€

my mom handles a lot documents, and doctors from all the wards come and go to her office to process paperwork. so it becomes evident that somebody could eventually bring the virus to the hr department.

on friday, march 27th, as my mom was going to sleep, she realized that she has a fever. from that moment on, we assume she is infected.

# this is outrageous, it's unfair

the next day, all the regular coronavirus symptoms showed up. fever, dry cough, weakness, and, quite unexpectedly, very painful sensations in back muscles and joints, making it very hard to find a comfortable sleeping position. during the first two days, she also experienced an unbearable headache. for quite a few days, she had a very loud, unstoppable, and exhausting cough.since my mom needed to get sick leave papers, on march 29th, she called for a doctor from a local public clinic. the doctor came, logged all the symptoms, and suggested symptomatic treatment. right away, my mom was tested for coronavirus.â 

the testing materials look like a pair of extremely long cue tips. they insert one in the nose, and another one in the throat. they cut these cue tips to leave only a short fragment with the cotton wad, put them in the test tube, and take them away.â 

in moscow, if youâ€™re ill and call for a doctor, tests are performed free of charge.the doctor says that the results will come in in 2 days, so my mom asked:

* but how will i get my results?
* don't worry, **they will find you**.

it's a very illogical system: if your results are positive, they will call you back - if theyâ€™re negative, they won't even bother informing you.

my mom got a sick leave for 2 weeks, and the doctor left.

on march 31st, my dad got a fever as well. we called for the doctor right away. his interaction with the doctor was identical to my mom's: symptomatic treatment, testing, wait for 2 days. aside from the fever, my dad didn't have any other symptoms.

all that time, i was staying at my parents' place. during the night, between april 2nd and 3rd, i got a fever as well. my symptoms were pretty much identical to my mom's. during the first 2 days, i felt weak and had an unbearable headache. i also experienced muscle and joint pain, which made it difficult to sit or even lie down. by the 3rd day, these symptoms started fading away. i had a dry cough, although it was mild in comparison to my mom's. however, starting on day 3, i got a horrible runny nose and sore throat.

i didn't call for a doctor, because i run my own business and don't need a sick leave.

# this is where the fun begins

fast forward to saturday, april 4. by that date, my mom was ill for 8 days already, and it was 6 days since she was tested. we thought it must have been coronavirus, although the results still didn't come in yet, and, by the logic suggested by the doctors, youâ€™re supposed to assume that the results are negative.

all of a sudden, my mom receives a call from some kind of a call center. they were asking my mom a lot of questions: how she feels, what her symptoms are, with whom she was in contact, where she works, with whom she lives, passport number, social security number, and so on. i am gonna refer to these questions as â€œthe standard list of questionsâ€ from now own.

when they learned that me and my dad live in the same place, they started asking her about us as well.

my mom asked about the test results, but the response was ""your results are inconclusive, so we are sending a doctor to administer another test.""

we got a visit from a very nice, joyful lady in an outfit which looks somewhat like a simplified hazmat suit made of cloth. this time, the doctor tested all of us. we asked when we would get the results, and she said that we will have to wait for 3 days. yet, it's the same principle again: they're not gonna inform you if it's negative.

the doctor left, and very soon afterwards, my mom received another call, this time informing her that a person will come and bring a so-called ""decree"". this decree will be dropped under the door, ""to avoid contact.""

my mom decided to ask once again:

* wait, but not too long ago i was told that my results are inconclusive?
* what do you mean, inconclusive? **they're positive.**

and that's how we learned for sure that my mom is infected.

i do understand that the accuracy of these tests is far from ideal, but i don't understand why one person says they're inconclusive, yet another person says they're positive. i am not sure if they were trying to conceal the result, or this was just some bureaucratic mistake - could be anything, really.so, my mom finally gets the decree. this decree says that my mom is forbidden to leave home, and violating it will result in an administrative fine.

interestingly enough, this document was backdated: my mom received it on april 4, but the document demands that she doesn't leave home beginning march 30, for 6 days, which means that she can leave home by april 5 - essentially, just one day after she received that decree, which doesn't make any sense.

i also need to point out that, at that moment, neither i, nor my dad, had received any decrees, although we were just as ill as my mom was. we weren't leaving home just because it was common sense.

# around the survivors, a perimeter create

the next day (april 5th), we received a call from the local police station. the police officer wanted to make sure that my mom was aware that she is not allowed to leave the apartment. he asked most of the questions from the standard list.

very soon afterwards, we got a visit from the ambulance team. it was two young girls in hazmat suits. this time these were proper hazmat suits - they were synthetic, and they covered the entire body, so no body part was exposed.

the ambulance got information that my mom is infected, and according to the procedure, they're supposed to check every infected patient.

they asked the standard questions, took our temperatures, and also checked the oxygen saturation in our blood using a device called a pulse oximeter. it's a non-invasive procedure - they attach this thingy to your finger, and the device tells them how much oxygen there is. they said that our results are fine, our condition is satisfactory, and then they started writing down our symptoms, logging our condition and all sorts of legal information in what seemed like an endless stack of papers.

eventually, the paper work was done, and the girls handed us all sorts of documents. my mom received a paper that clearly states that she has a positive result and extends her stay-at-home order to 14 days since the ambulance's visit, overriding the previously received decree.

my dad and i were classified as ""persons in contact with coronavirus patient,"" and we received decrees that forbid us to leave our apartment until my mom recovers, plus 14 days since that moment.

also, since it seems that we have mild cases of coronavirus, the ambulance suggested that we receive remote care. we signed papers that we all agree to stay home (instead of being hospitalized) and receive telemedicine services instead.

finally, they handed each of us 4 professionally designed pamphlets about coronavirus which explain how to clean and disinfect your apartment, which number to call if you start feeling worse, and all sorts of other useful information for the patients and their relatives.

as they were leaving, they told us that we should take this seriously and not go outside. if we didnâ€™t listen, the police would take us to the hospital by force, which, if you ask me, makes total sense, especially considering that some russians don't believe that the virus exists and completely ignore self-isolation advice.

# there is always a bigger fish

after the ambulance's visit on april 5, we probably didn't have a single day that our phones didnâ€™t ring. almost every day, each of us would receive a call from an organization checking on our condition. initially, each of us would receive at least 3 calls daily.

here's a list of organizations:

* local public clinic
* police
* ambulance
* coronavirus hq. yes, apparently, they created an organization specifically for the purpose of fighting coronavirus.
* rospotrebnadzor, a funny sounding word which is translated to english as ""the federal service for surveillance on consumer rights protection and human wellbeing""
* volunteers. they usually do chores for people over 65, but they reluctantly help coronavirus patients as well (not their fault, but rather their managementâ€™s policy, and they respond to the moscow government)
* telemedicine, which, it turns out, is completely independent from the local clinic and the ambulance and is completely unaware of what either of these two were doing

i've managed to count 7 organizations, but there might have been more, because some people on the phone identified themselves vaguely, or said that they were from the moscow government call-center or something like that.

# if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!

aside from that, coronavirus hq called me once, and asked all the standard questions. the next day, the very same coronavirus hq calls, and asked me the same questions again. of course, i complained to the operator that i had already answered most of these questions (granted, some of the questions were new), but they said that i might have confused them with somebody else.

i am 100% sure that i wouldn't confuse an organization with such a memorable name with anybody else on the list.

# i donâ€™t think the system works

honestly, i appreciate all that attention a lot, because i really did not expect that anybody would actually take care of us. but, sadly, there's really not much use from all that activity. they ask the same standard questions all the time, so each of us had to re-tell the whole story all over again to each and every organization. there is clearly no cooperation between them - they do not share information with each other.

besides, we ran into a few problems, and, when none of the organizations provided any help, we had to figure something out.

**problem #1**, very hard to buy groceries. in moscow, there are a lot of food delivery services to choose from, but because of the coronavirus, many of them are completely booked at least a week in advance. the only solution we found is to wake up very early and check whether any of these services have an empty delivery timeframe and book it asap. fortunately, very soon after we got our decrees, a new service called yandex.lavka opened in my area, and they deliver any groceries within 20 minutes after you place the order. thankfully, this completely solved the problem, because now, if we need basic groceries, we can always order from there.

**problem #2**, taking out the trash. we have a dumpster outside of our apartment building, and obviously we can't go out. occasionally, when we get a visit from a doctor or somebody else, we ask if it's ok for them to take out our trash for us. it's unclear to me whether it's safe. there are no official guidelines regarding trash, but at least people in protective gear generally do not refuse and take out our trash for us. yet now these visits are becoming less frequent, so there's still no elegant solution to this problem.

**problem #3**, getting medicine. if you need any kind of drugs, you don't really have any option to get them. drug stores, at least the ones we know, don't deliver orders to your apartment, and you have to pick them up somehow. when we pointed out these problems, a few organizations suggested calling the moscow government hotline to ask for the volunteersâ€™ help.

however, when we called them, they initially refused helping us because we're ""too young.â€ when we mentioned that my dad needs to buys some meds and has some chronic diseases, they decided to classify us as in the at-risk group, and sent a volunteer. the volunteer paid for our order at the drug store, dropped it off in front of our door to avoid contact, and we compensated them for the order using online banking.

# time to abandon ship

this is already a huge story, so i will try to condense the rest of it.

we were tested 2 more times. thus, my parents were tested 4 times, and i was tested 3 times in total.

on april 11th, independently from each other, me and my dad received a call from coronavirus hq, informing us that we have positive results. they were unaware which exact test came in positive, but i assume it was the one we took a week ago, on april 4.

on april 14 (will confirm the date later), the last time they tested us, me and my dad were re-classified as â€œcoronavirus patientsâ€ and my mom was re-classified as â€œperson in contact with coronavirus patients.â€ â our stay at home orders were extended until april 24.

and, since april 17th, which is more than 2 weeks after i was infected, we have started receiving calls from the telemedicine service, which now checks on us (almost) every day.

# a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one!

i am surprised by the amount of attention we received from our healthcare system. and i am infinitely grateful to all the people who were checking on our conditions, some of them risking their health when walking into our apartment.

but there are some things i can complain about, and they mostly have to do with the management of these organizations.

**first** **of all**: never-ending calls from all these organizations, asking the same questions over and over again. either the list of organizations must be shorter, or they must establish some channel of communication or at least exchange information. they're wasting precious time on patients who don't really need immediate medical attention.

**second**: none of our problems were really addressed. sometimes, they suggest asking for the volunteersâ€™ help, but if you're under 65, you're on your own. there are no guidelines regarding trash and if it should be thrown out or not. volunteers said they're not allowed to throw out the trash, although people from the other organizations didn't mind taking it out for us - meaning, if there is some kind of guideline, only the volunteers are aware of it.

**third**: absolutely no transparency when it comes to test results. you are randomly informed by some organization that you're positive, and they don't even know which particular test it was. i understand that many people are tested at the same time, that the system is overloaded, and it takes more than a week to get your results. but it's unclear why they didn't make these results available online, especially considering that our government has a very convenient website where you can get all sorts of government services - it would make a lot of sense to make our results available there.

**fourth**: the unimaginable amount of bureaucracy. it takes 5 minutes to check our conditions and take the tests, yet every single doctor that visited us stayed in our apartment for at least an hour to fill out all the paperwork. when the emts in hazmat suits visited us, there were a few times when they didn't know what exactly they're supposed to write down in their papers, so they had to call their hq to guide them, and the hq started joking that the girls aren't thinking clearly. and the girls joyfully responded that they've been wearing these suits for hours, it's hard to breathe, and of course it's hard to think straight under these conditions. all this bureaucracy essentially puts their health at risk and doesn't really help achieve anything.

on the bright side, i received all of that attention for free.â well, not exactly for free - it's funded by us, the taxpayers. still, i am glad this experience didn't turn into an additional financial burden for my family.

aside from that, putin announced that all businesses and organizations must keep paying salaries to their employees. obviously, this doesn't work for the private sector - many private companies went bankrupt and had to lay off their employees. thankfully, my parents work in the public medical sector, and although they're on sick leave, it seems they will receive 100% of their salary. there is a problem, though: they won't be able to receive their salary until they officially end their sick leave (plus a few days after that), and this might take a while.â 

i am less lucky, because i have my own company, and there is no support for businesses from the government at the moment, so i have to survive on my own. but, at the very least, i am glad that all my recent adventures didn't turn into another expense.

i hope you found my story interesting. if you have any friends skeptical about the effects of coronavirus, perhaps my story will somehow convince them that the whole thing should be taken seriously. if russia as a country finally decided to treat the problem that seriously, maybe they should, too.

i wish you all good health, and my respect to all the essential workers whose lives are at a huge risk and who help me not to die from hunger.

be safe!

# edit 1: pics and recent developments

i've uploaded photos of emts, scans of the pamphlets they handed out, and took pictures of the ""social monitoring"" smartphones that the government supplied us with:  
[https://imgur.com/a/hqr4beh](https://imgur.com/a/hqr4beh)

when emts visited us, we signed papers that we acknowledge that we are legally not allowed to leave home and that we agree to receive telemedicine service instead of being hospitalized. 

this agreement also implies that each of us has to receive a smartphone that tracks our geolocation and asks us to take selfies every once in a while, to make sure we stay home. 

they were supposed to deliver these phones shortly after emts' visit on april 5. we received them on april 20, when it was clear we're recovering.

the phones are manufactured by huawei :)   
soon after huawei was banned in the us, they started befriending russian government. 

it immediately became clear that our government built the whole system very hastily - it's incredibly buggy, unintuitive and essentially useless. when you turn on this phone for the first time, it asks you to take a selfie to authorize. then it shows you this blank home screen, and...  that's it. on this screen, you can't do anything at all, you're just staring at the clock. there are no buttons to press, nothing. good for elderly people, i guess, but at the same time you'd think they'd explain what you have to expect from this device.

two days after we first authorized, our phones started buzzing. this time, when we unlocked our  phones, they offered to take selfies again. however, all our phones failed to recognize our faces. 

* on the first attempt, it said: 1 attempt left 
* on the second attempt, it said: -1 attempt left 

and then returned back to the blank home screen. they didn't even bother offering us to make another attempt.

well, at the very least i feel safer now, because not only the russian government checks on me, but probably the chinese government, too.

later that day (april 20), we received a call informing us that our last tests, taken on april 14, came in negative. they also said that thanks to negative results our stay-at-home orders will be lifted by april 24, and they promised that on april 24 we will receive a call with further instructions. 

needless to say, nobody called us that day, so now we stay in this weird limbo state - we supposedly can go outside, but at the same it's all very confusing and nobody instructed us what to do next. they are also supposed to take these smartphones back, which they haven't done yet.

g55vkg,2020-04-20 21:30:00 UTC,"i've been reading through a lot of the posts on here the last few days and thought i should post my own covid-19 story.
for reference, i live in toronto. i had been going to work but other than that all other contact has been limited to weekly grocery store visits and the occasional walk around the block for the last 4 weeks. most of the symptoms i describe from april 11- 16 were so mild i had to go back and think about them once i learned i was positive. i should mention my job requires me to work in close contact with covid positive patient blood samples. 

apr 11-woke up feeling fine. as the day went on my brain started to feel really foggy. i have anxiety that comes and goes in cycles, so i chalked it up to lack of exercise while being cooped up at home. felt a little bit tired but nothing else. checked my temperature a few times over the day and never had a temperature over 98f.

april 12-brain fog still present. no cough, no fever, noticed a bit of a need to clear my throat a few times an hour, thought it was probably from the joint i had smoked the night before.

april 13-16. brain fog persisted, worsening as the day went on. had what i would describe as a very mild sinus infection. sinuses were mostly clear but could feel slight pressure behind my eyes and felt like i couldn't get my ears to ""pop"" and equalize the pressure. no other ""typical"" covid symptoms. at no point did i suspect i was positive. 

april 17-18-brain fog and minor sinus issues have completely subsided. but then very abruptly i came down with profound loss of smell. had no sinus blockage and could breath fine but found i was unable to smell a thing. i could not even smell a hint of things that are normally quite pungent like fresh rosemary, vanilla extract, or blue cheese. could still taste but only the basic flavours of sweet, salty, bitter, and sour. 

april 19-feel completely healthy but still no sense of smell. reading many stories about loss of smell as a covid symptom. decide to fill out the online assessment form. contacted shortly after by a nurse performing screens. i mentioned my loss of smell as the main symptom. due to the fact that i was working with covid positive samples the screener recommended i be tested. immediately went to the test center and received a very uncomfortable nasal swab. felt totally healthy for the rest of the day.

april 20-was super surprised to recieve a call less than 24 hours after being tested confirming i was positive. felt mostly fine but started feeling tired and got a minor headache in the later afternoon. felt a little bit warm but confirmed no fever. took an advil and feel fine again. 

overall i've been super lucky to have such mild to non existant symptoms and i'm crossing my fingers that it stays that way. for anyone reading this; if you find that your sense of smell very suddenly disappears i'd recommend treating yourself as positive and immediately staying in self isolation. you may not be showing any symptoms, but it's s scary how many people could be out there going about their daily lives while spreading this thing around.",$$$sinus$$$reading$$$but$$$smell$$$cough$$$but$$$smell$$$brain fog$$$anxiety$$$sense$$$thought$$$joint$$$temperature$$$but$$$smell$$$goes$$$smell$$$smell$$$sinus$$$brain fog$$$before$$$but$$$reading$$$temperature$$$thought$$$tired$$$but$$$but$$$sinuses$$$ears$$$came$$$but$$$but$$$fever$$$self$$$headache$$$throat$$$taste$$$but$$$warm$$$sinus$$$but$$$breath$$$smell$$$tired$$$reading$$$nasal$$$foggy$$$eyes$$$fever$$$smell$$$brain fog$$$sense$$$,"$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Arthralgia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Palpitations$$$Anosmia$$$Anosmia$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Headache$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Ageusia$$$Pyrexia$$$Hot Flush$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Anosmia$$$Fatigue$$$Dyspnea$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Eye pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Anosmia$$$",$$$C0948596$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0012833$$$C1832070$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0003862$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0030252$$$C0003126$$$C0003126$$$C0948596$$$C0012833$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0948596$$$C0013456$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C0018681$$$C2363731$$$C2364111$$$C0015967$$$C0600142$$$C0948596$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0003126$$$C0015672$$$C0013404$$$C1260880$$$C0012833$$$C0151827$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0012833$$$C0003126$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

i didnt go outside unless i needed to.
but somehow i felt so bad, i had to call my doctor. i had a small fever 38.4 celcius, and when i have fever they need to check my heart because i have brugada syndrome. at the hospital i tested positief for covid 19.

everything was oke, and no reason for me to stay in the hospital. at home my fever raised up to 41.2 celcius. but i managed to get over it.

if had no fever now for 2 weeks. i cough like 10 times per day now, i used to cough like every 5 minutes when sick. i even feel great, can take deep breates noting hurts everything like normal for 2 weeks now.

but i still cough 10 / 15 times per day and still have headache.
if been laying in carantaine for 4 weeks now in my room, its just laying in bad all day and netflix, but they wont test me again, according to my doctor a nother test is pointless.

i am a 28 year old female from the usa. no pre-existing health conditions, in shape, eat healthy, good bmi etc. 

i was diagnosed covid-positive on the 23rd of march. tomorrow it will be an entire month.  this is my 4th and perhaps worst wave of symptoms. 

after struggling on and off for weeks at home, i was admitted to the hospital. i was vomiting uncontrollably, running a 95.9-96.0 degree temp (too low), struggling to breathe on my own and had severe sweats and violent chills. turns out my pulse oxygen was very low which they helped with right away. they also ran another slew of tests. 

after my chest x-ray, ekg and ct of chestâ€”the doctors came in to let me know that my pulmonary artery was extremely dilated (the doc said he usually sees this in people in their 70s and 80s). they are unsure if the damage to my lungs from covid has affected my heart and arteries. they did notice that my lung function was back to normal but some abnormal spots on my lungs perhaps left behind by covid.

i was also retested via nasal swab to see if there were still traces of covid in my system after a month of continuous symptoms. waiting on all of the results now and i am very nervous and concerned. has anyone had anything that has gone on this long? anyone dealing with potential heart damage? 

thanks for reading. be well.

g5oepk,2020-04-21 17:44:00 UTC,"# my four key learnings from covid

# it all felt so surreal.

my symptoms began in mid-march 2020 following an international flight back to the us via london. i have not experienced a flu or even a fever in 15 years, so something felt clearly different when within a few days of arrival, i was hit by multiple symptoms spread out over 2 weeks: cough, fever, body ache, diarrhea, an altered sense of smell and taste, and what not. with some difficulty, i was able to get a covid-19 test which came back positive (after 8 days of waiting!). later, my wife, who experienced a somewhat different set of symptoms, tested positive. long story short, we were lucky to recover with relatively mild symptoms without taking special medications or a trip to the hospitalâ€¦ but it was not exactly a cakewalk.

i am not detailing my journey here as different people will have very different experiences, there are plenty of personal stories on the internet, and i do not wish to bias you with my own. rather, based on my experience and having read quite a bit of research and first-person accounts, i will share my key learnings as of mid-april 2020.

i assume you are quite familiar with the novel coronavirus situation so i will not overly repeat the most common stuff you see in news articles.

**1. we really know very little**

when i started to look for reliable information on covid, i discovered that a lot about the novel corona virus is still unknown and experts are coming up with best guesses. even the research is still preliminary. it is not clear why some people have mild symptoms while others end up on a ventilator. i learned that are many hypotheses premised on such things as viral load, blood group, age, gender, co-morbidities, immune conditions, and other vulnerabilities.

as you go through this maze, try to find out for yourself what is likely to be true, what is false, and what is a well-founded opinion. consult reliable sources. however, do not automatically take authorities for granted, regardless of whether they are governments or health professionals. the situation and knowledge is changing all the time. additional confusion is created by wild conspiracy theories, touted covid cures (with mixed or little evidence), deliberate misinformation, and unfounded opinions and ideas.

>**be healthily skeptical of all data, experts, news reports, forwarded messages, and opinions (including my own:))**

**2. covid is mysterious and unpredictable**

the symptoms of covid-19 are very diverse and vary widely in severity from mild to extreme. not everyone will have fever or most of the symptoms. some people will be asymptomatic. some of the symptoms may be there one day but not the next. some symptoms may happen suddenly. some symptoms may last well over a month. you may feel good one day but symptoms may appear again after a few days. **there seems to be no uniform pattern.** (even after full recovery, there is a period of time when one may not feel fully normal.) you should keep an eye on symptoms for a month or longer.

>**there may be a need to question current cdc guidelines, which specify when to return to work.**

everyone knows that if you are older or have other health conditions such as bp, diabetes, obesity, and heart disease, you have to be very very careful of not catching covid. **however, even if you are relatively healthy or young, you should take all the precautions as there is a mystery to this disease.** there are many theories but we still don't know why it strikes some young and healthy individuals severely or suddenly while others may not have realized they were infected. moreover, a young person, especially in a multi-generation/joint family, could easily pass it on to elders.

**3. don't go easy ...**

we already know this disease is mysterious and unpredictable. however, even the mild symptoms of covid are not as simple as experiencing the flu. consistent with our experience and many first-person stories i read, even in cases that were mild, patients were physically and emotionally drained, while the severe cases could be fatal. besides, not enough is known about long-term effects as well as potential immunity (how much?, how long?) after recovery. tests for covid are still not widely available. many tests are not fda approved but just authorized for emergency use, such as the one i got. many tests suffer from a high rate of false negatives. antibody tests are still unreliable (as of mid-april 2020). some drugs appear promising but the evidence for their effectiveness is still preliminary.

>**your goal should be to take precautions to not catch the disease, at least until reliable therapies, medicines, and vaccines are available.**

**4. this is a time for caring and wisdom**

upon our return to the us, within a few days, we were pleasantly surprised and touched to see on my doorstep things we needed the most ... a box of wipes, some tissue, and a thermometer. what a simple touching act of care from our neighbor. a friend left some home-made food on our doorstep. a few friends friends who knew our situation stayed in touch. we had not informed many people so as not to alarm them. physicians in our family and among friends were guides. my wife and i isolated ourselves in different rooms and took care of each other even as our children and family in different cities made sure we were doing okay.

in the face of so much pain from loss of life and livelihood, a fear and anxiety mentality has gripped the world. see if you can separate fact from emotion. fear should not prevent us from right action.

>**in other words, be ""intelligently"" cautious, not overly fearful, paranoid or paralyzed.**

side by side, we are seeing all around us a sense of thankfulness for life and a respect for health workers and others who are at the front lines of this pandemic. **can we act with compassion and understanding for others, even as we are dealing with our own fears?**

when locked down in one physical place, one can feel the need to connect with friends and family as well as the propensity to consume all manners of entertainment and streaming video. **however, can we also use this time to know oneself better and find what we really value in this world?** can we meditate and connect with nature? with an inner stillness or divinity? can reflection co-exist with entertainment?

for me, along with other things, covid was a learning, witnessing opportunity - to watch fear, hope, anxiety, impatience, coping, scientific curiosity, and love in oneself and in the world.

i am now hoping to donate plasma... if i can get a second test for ""negative"" or an antibody test, which my county currently says are unavailable to me. i may have to wait a bit ...

the past month has been quite a journey.

# it still feels surreal.

edit: tested my bp and temperature on april 22 (today). both were in my normal range. so everything seems normalized now. will update after a few days.

hey all

so i've been working from home for a month now, and around 2 weeks ago i started to feel really crappy. my lungs got tighter, a lot tighter, my whole body felt achey and i felt tired all the time.

i have asthma and i'm used to my lungs getting tighter and then using my inhalers to prevent and relieve it. well those stopped working. i called my gp and got prescribed antibiotics, as it had a similar feeling to a chest infection, which i've had a few times before. my gp suggested at that point that i have a few coronavirus symptoms and should self-isolate for 7 days.

i started taking antibiotics and again noticed no difference whatsoever.

my partner works in care, and her employer arranged for us to go get tested. wierdly, she was not allowed to get tested as she has zero symptoms, despite her living in the same house as me. i got tested; for those who don't know, the test (for me, in the uk) was a long swab that goes down to the back of your throat twice, followed by a swap up the nose.

3 days later i got my results via text message (which is still really odd to me!), i tested positive!

i was quite shocked by it at first, i didn't know what to think, i told my parents and some of my friends that were already worried about me.

some of my symptoms have included:  
\- dizziness  
\- a ""pressurised"" feeling head, kinda like sinus pain  
\- light headedness  
\- aching body  
\- tight lungs/shortness of breath  
\- high temperature feelings  
\- gross, phlegmmy coughs (ew)  
\- on/off loss of smell/taste  
\- on/off wierd taste/smells lingering

i had all of these at the same time, and wow i've never felt so bad. last night i was feeling immense pressure in my face/head, and felt weak and wobbly, it was quite scary.

however i woke up this morning and feel improved, after 14 days of feeling terrible. i'm not 100% and hopefully it'll continue to improve.

it's not clear to me what i'm supposed to do. i called my gp again and told them the news, they basically said to just keep an eye on my breathing, if it gets to a point where i'm struggling i just need to call an ambulance. scary thoughts!

anyways, there's my story so far. hope i make it through, seems to be ok so far.",$$$aching$$$smell$$$goes$$$tired$$$dizziness$$$tighter$$$breathing$$$throat$$$light headedness$$$taste$$$self$$$tighter$$$whole$$$similar$$$breath$$$nose$$$tighter$$$gross phlegmmy coughs$$$worried$$$head$$$coughs$$$sinus$$$taste$$$tight$$$achey$$$head$$$before$$$eye$$$temperature$$$weak$$$,"$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Anosmia$$$Palpitations$$$Fatigue$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Chest tightness$$$Dyspnea$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Ageusia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Chest tightness$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Chest pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Chest tightness$$$Cough$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Headache$$$Cough$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Ageusia$$$Chest tightness$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Headache$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Eye pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$",$$$C0741585$$$C0003126$$$C0030252$$$C0015672$$$C0012833$$$C0235710$$$C0013404$$$C2363731$$$C0012833$$$C2364111$$$C0012833$$$C0235710$$$C0741585$$$C0008031$$$C0013404$$$C1260880$$$C0235710$$$C0010200$$$C1832070$$$C0018681$$$C0010200$$$C0948596$$$C2364111$$$C0235710$$$C0741585$$$C0018681$$$C0013456$$$C0151827$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
g5t38n,2020-04-21 22:36:00 UTC,"as more and more of us are battling covid-19, i think we are all gaining more knowledge and insight into how the virus manifests in different people and just how different our paths to recovery are.  thereâ€™s not one typical, clear picture as to what that is.  

my story (condensed): i tested positive 3/31 after becoming symptomatic 3/29. i am a nurse, most likely got sick from exposure to undiagnosed and possibly asymptomatic carriers without ppe.  though i have a clinically defined â€œmild caseâ€ (i am lucky to be recovering at home and i have not been hospitalized), itâ€™s been marred by the unpredictable.  iâ€™ve experienced changing of symptoms, symptoms that wax and wane, symptoms that flare up at different parts of the day, etc.

initially, my symptoms presented as: exhaustion/fatigue (despite my prescribed adderall), back pain, horrible neck pain & joint pain specifically knees (despite lidocaine patches & tylenol), a dry cough, some vague upper respiratory issues unattributed to allergies at the time like sinus pressure (used claritin and flonase-no relief), temperatures (despite tylenol), yeast infection for like...3 weeks before noticing all these other symptoms (despite otc meds and doses of diflucan), intense all day migraines that i couldnâ€™t break despite using my anti-abortive migraine medication, etc. 

â€”->thread regarding my timeline of symptoms if you want to read in more detail. [my timeline of symptoms](https://www.reddit.com/r/covid19positive/comments/fujjin/nurse_37_yo_f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

each day after the initial 7 days of illness, iâ€™ve had different â€œwavesâ€ of symptoms or a resurgence of symptoms i thought went away, or new symptoms.  

for a few days only i thought maybe i was starting to feel better except then i developed vomiting and constipation for a few days, abdominal pain and cramping (literally laid on my bathroom floor in severe pain).  the vomiting, pain, cramping went away but nausea persisted. i had migraines every day, then they went away for a week, then came back for a few days, then went away.  i would have a low grade temp on tylenol for days on end, then would go a day without a fever, for it to come back. 

breakdown:

what has remained constant or almost constant for me since symptoms began has been: 
-mod-severe joint pain and muscle pain in knees, neck, back all day long
-loss of smell & taste
-fatigue/exhaustion
-feeling dehydrated despite trying to increase fluids 

for less than a week but greater than 3 days in a row:
-nausea
-vomiting
-abdominal cramping/pain/bloating/constipation 
-chills 

for a week to two weeks straight:
-waking with a pounding migraine each morning
-eye pain, sensitivity to light 
-low grade fevers
-sweats
-fatigue upon exertion
-poor tolerance for activities 

intermittent: 
-anxiety
-dizziness
-sore throat
-itchy skin
-loss of appetite
-forgetfulness 

iâ€˜m knackered, frustrated, and tired of being sick.  i was the first at my facility to have a positive test, those who have tested positive after me have returned to work and iâ€™m still having symptoms. i am anxious and irritable at thinking of going back to work, and thatâ€™s not me, i love being a nurse. 

personally iâ€™d like to use this space for people to share experiences as we go through this, so perhaps itâ€™s less alienating, confusing, and maybe less stigmatized.  to commiserate, to share symptoms other than those as most recognized, etc.

please feel free to share:
 
1. date of your first symptoms and what they were
2. date diagnosed positive test (maybe share how many days you had to wait to get tested and how many days until you received test results if you know this)
3. how your symptoms have changed, stabilized, resurgence of any, etc
4. how you are doing, mental health wise if you feel comfortable sharing,

went to er again, said they checked my blood last week, so didnâ€™t need to check again, x-ray lungs heart and had ekg, still no ct yet.  vitals normals,  said i was fine then i went home.  hopefully itâ€™s nothing serious and itâ€™ll clear up, all my symptoms seem to change, i feel like iâ€™m getting better, maybe this is one of the last ones?  is weird starting new issues at 33 though have to say.

g64486,2020-04-22 12:20:00 UTC,"hello everyone,

i recently was positive for covid. i am a 26 year old male and i was exposed on 3/29/20 and i haven't had symptoms for the last 15-ish days so i am pretty sure i am in the clear. myself and my extended family got exposed. when i was researching on here, all i could find were doom and gloom stories about people on day 30 and day 40 etc. and it would spike my anxiety (i have bad anxiety). you guys can check my post history. i was a nervous wreck! 

heres the thing: stop researching and looking on these subreddits. it is a small population of people that are getting the worst of the ""mild"" cases. i came back on here because i wanted to post and make people realize it isn't as bad as every story. people who usually are fine and recover do not post about their recoveries on reddit. they just go about their life. each person is different.

my uncle is in his early 60s. his case was severe in the sense that he had to go to the hospital to get oxygen for 10 days. my aunt also was positive and she had a 100-102 fever and a slight cough for 4-5 days and thats it. my elder cousin who is 34 got it and he had gi symptoms and 101-102 temperature for 4-5 days. my other cousin who is 28 just lost his sense of smell/taste for 5 days. i had a low grade fever and extreme fatigue for 5 days and then it went away. no cough or sob. however, if you see from my post history, my anxiety was fueling my ""sob"". i have a history of anxiety and i have been taking medication for it. therefore, i could tell the difference. i am not trying to minimize what others are going through. all i am trying to do is to post more positive, reassuring stories for the people on this sub that are struggling or are on that day 40 and need to see something that is optimistic. my uncle has diabetes and my aunt has hypertension and now they are fine. we're all fine (my anxiety has sky-rocketed but thats a different story)

the moral of the story is stop researching on any sub-reddit. get off the news/social media. delete the apps off your phone if it is really bothering you. stress makes things worse. try and surround yourself with positivity. facetime family/friends, watch a funny show, meditate, etc. whatever works for you. your mental health is just as important. your case may end up being very mild which was what happened to 4 of the 5 family members in my life.

g651mq,2020-04-22 13:10:00 UTC,"i posted a few days ago about my story, then it was day 36. iâ€™m doing better but still not over this thing. 

my family is in another state and they donâ€™t think that covid can last this long in a mild case. my mother says sheâ€™s read tons all over the internet and canâ€™t find anything about anyone being sick this long. she says that people on ventilators are recovering in 6 weeks. 

well iâ€™m about to hit 6 weeks on friday and iâ€™m not recovered. i still have a low fever all day. i still am totally exhausted and need tons of sleep. too much exertion can really set me back and start the coughing fits again. 

my family are saying iâ€™m not trying hard enough to â€œreengage in my lifeâ€. that all i talk about is covid. theyâ€™re worried iâ€™m going to go into a depression, but the things theyâ€™re saying are definitely not helping to keep that from happening. 

so i guess iâ€™m posting hoping some empathy from those of you that understand what this is like. and iâ€™m  hoping someone might have some data that i can send my family to prove to them iâ€™m not insane and that iâ€™m not the only one thatâ€™s sick this long with mild illness.

g67kyp,2020-04-22 15:26:00 UTC,"i wasnâ€™t going to post on this subreddit until i had recovered but have decided to do it now to hopefully help others in similar situation and for any advice people can provide.

some details about me iâ€™m 27 male, normal bmi with no known underlying conditions, blood type o+ and presumed positive from gp and hospital. i have been off work the entire time resting and trying to recover. i will list my symptoms by week but just to say that a lot of these symptoms have been on and off as most people have experienced. i also want to say i do believe my symptoms have been on the mild end (apart from somethings which i will explain) and i havenâ€™t had a prolonged stay in hospital.

week 1: symptoms started 24th march with an â€˜offâ€™ feeling most of the day and then a fever kicked in by the evening. cough was very light at this point and only happening few times a day. i was shivering at points and also some sob but not too significant. i also had a deep burning sensation in lungs felt like a furnace in there. light nosebleed noticed as well which cleared week 2.
towards end of week i also developed loss of appetite for about 4-5 days but canâ€™t remember losing taste/smell. on the third/fourth day i seemed to take turn for the worst, initially lying in bed trying to sleep i got an intense tingling through hands and eventually face, breathing became very laboured and intense tight chest, almost fainted. this was obviously me hyperventilating but was very scary at the time as i have never suffered from anxiety/panic attacks before. an ambulance arrived on this day and apart from tachycardia everything ok. unfortunately next morning at 5am woke again felt bad and another episode of hyperventilating and was asked to attend hospital. after a couple hours i mostly recovered, x ray, ecg fine and bloods all ok expect slightly high calcium. 

week 2: into week 2 i continued to have fever, loss of appetite and slight sob. at this point i started to feel ok at very brief intervals but still felt generally unwell, was also having very vivid dreams and dry mouth waking up. towards end of week shakes came back and gained aches in neck and around body along with weakness and fatigue. i also had one weird symptom with vision called an ocular migraine with no pain, very odd. gained appetite by end of week too.

week 3: fever seemed to break this week. had similar symptoms to week 2 but had larger periods of feeling better in between worse symptoms but still not great. this week however i gained diarrhoea for a few days with about a week of gurgling in abdomen beforehand so i expected this was coming. cough weirdly became a bit worse but not significantly, it felt the cough was vibrating my chest more. i noticed this week more intermittent aches in chest and that my heart rate would increase very easily and would take a while to settle. this week i also had some worsening dizziness but would subside by end of day. 

week 4: felt some improvement start of the week but dipped towards end, one day i had very painful neck and back but lasted just a day at that intensity. my intermittent cough was still chesty and i started to notice my extremities, particularly my hands, getting easily cold and red finger tips. heart palpitations are continuing as well. i also woke up early in morning this week with abdomen pains in left side but this lasted just two nights. my gp this week requested i get another set of bloods and observations done, these came back fine again, just a test called mchc was slightly high (anemia? not sure). i also noticed this week i was having slight muscle twitching, and light trembling in body and right arm but these symptoms do not last long or not noticeable most of the time. 
my worst day since week 1 happened monday towards the end of this week. i had felt probably the best iâ€™ve felt in the morning and coming inside from the garden in the evening i suddenly got very cold, several minutes later i felt just very â€˜unwellâ€™ then my heart rate shot up to about 130bpm and was struggling, after about 15 minutes iâ€™d say i started hyperventilating again! this time i felt more in control, but still going tingly and tight/crushing chest. my girlfriend decided to call 111 again and we waited for a callback from a doctor. in this time i become very hot and then this dropped off and i felt cool, i was shaking more then i have before and was very scared but trying to stay calm. the doctor called back after an hour and still no improvement in heart rate, so i was sent back to the hospital. xray and ecg done again with just tachycardia picked up on. my heart rate stayed +100bpm for probably over 3 hours. i had bloods done again and was told something that indicates my body was fighting something was marginally high but no concern. they also said lactate was high and was given iv fluids (still concerned about this). very late at this point so i didnâ€™t get much information from doctor but was eventually discharged with no explanation so i believe they put it down to anxiety/panic attack but iâ€™m not sure at this point. 

week 5: the next morning felt pretty bad and lost appetite again but only for breakfast. i feel worse last couple days then most of the last week and maybe even week before. breathing feels more laboured then iâ€™ve felt also. i have tried to increase my movements this week by going for some short walks as i donâ€™t think itâ€™s doing me any good sitting and lying down for past 4 weeks. 

iâ€™ve bound to have missed some symptoms but thats were i am today, thought i was over this but things keep coming back but i do feel on a slightly upward trend i guess. my heart rate and cold extremities are probably concerning me the most and the big step back i took on monday, can definitely feel more aches and pain in chest/ribs and abdomen now also, very disheartening :(

sorry for the lengthy post but appreciate it if you have read it. i have felt better each week but just sometimes comes with big setbacks. another few points, i got an oximeter around week 3 which has helped keep an eye on things, oxygen seems to fluctuate but never went below 97, iâ€™d recommend getting one if you can. iâ€™m also very aware that some of my symptoms could be caused by anxiety and i hope some of these symptoms are but as i have never suffered with it before its hard to believe its causing what iâ€™m experiencing. 

i really donâ€™t know if iâ€™m still having covid symptoms or have i gained something new but iâ€™m hoping i can keep improving and will update to hopefully be another recovered story soon. thank to all for your updates on this subreddit and your support to everyone.",$$$migraine$$$fatigue$$$cough$$$heart rate$$$tachycardia$$$but$$$before$$$tachycardia$$$tight$$$sleep$$$but$$$panic$$$before$$$appetite$$$tachycardia$$$similar$$$burning$$$weakness$$$anxiety$$$but$$$heart rate$$$something$$$but$$$smell$$$but$$$panic attacks$$$cough$$$before$$$fever$$$panic attacks$$$cough$$$but$$$heart rate$$$appetite$$$but$$$appetite$$$but$$$but$$$sob$$$panic$$$came$$$painful$$$neck$$$but$$$breathing$$$tachycardia$$$came$$$vision$$$ribs$$$appetite$$$but$$$anxiety$$$but$$$but$$$but$$$dizziness$$$panic attack$$$thought$$$but$$$but$$$breathing$$$taste$$$heart palpitations$$$fever$$$arm$$$muscle$$$but$$$shakes$$$but$$$but$$$anxiety$$$tight$$$cough$$$but$$$heart rate$$$neck$$$heart rate$$$but$$$something$$$palpitations$$$but$$$shaking$$$but$$$similar$$$something$$$diarrhoea$$$scared$$$panic attack$$$fever$$$sob$$$tachycardia$$$eye$$$shivering$$$but$$$tachycardia$$$but$$$before$$$but$$$but$$$sitting$$$but$$$,"$$$Migraine$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Palpitations$$$Palpitations$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Palpitations$$$Chest tightness$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Loss of appetite$$$Palpitations$$$Chest pain$$$Chest pain$$$Fatigue$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Loss of appetite$$$Pyrexia$$$Loss of appetite$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$Chest pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Palpitations$$$Cough$$$Visual impairment$$$Chest pain$$$Loss of appetite$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Ageusia$$$Palpitations$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Myalgia$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Chest tightness$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Palpitations$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Palpitations$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Palpitations$$$Eye pain$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$",$$$C0149931$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0030252$$$C0030252$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0030252$$$C0235710$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0013456$$$C0232462$$$C0030252$$$C0008031$$$C0008031$$$C0015672$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0232462$$$C0015967$$$C0232462$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0008031$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0030252$$$C0010200$$$C3665347$$$C0008031$$$C0232462$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C2364111$$$C0030252$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0231528$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0235710$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0741585$$$C0030252$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C0030252$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0008031$$$C0235710$$$C0011991$$$C1832070$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0030252$$$C0151827$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

firstly thank you to everyoneâ€™s nice messages of support when i posted 10 days ago. 

secondly just wanted to give you all a happy update. the last time i posted i still wasnâ€™t feeling great but day by day itâ€™s got better. 

my throat no longer hurts, iâ€™m still more fatigued that usual but iâ€™m free of the dreaded virus now. 

i hope everyone is doing ok and i just wanted to pass on a positive update that even if youâ€™re not the most healthy person in the world you can overcome it, you will feel shit, youâ€™ll worry, youâ€™ll take a while to get over it but in most cases you will get there. stay safe if you can.",$$$pass$$$fatigued$$$throat$$$but$$$but$$$worry$$$but$$$,"$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Fatigue$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$",$$$C0012833$$$C0015672$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

regardless, i've been finishing out my quarantine. had a difficult time doing the nasal swab as well- it was very difficult for me to keep it in my nose. i'm wondering if the test came back negative due to it being so late in my illness. i've been lucky- high fever for 3 days, and then steady incline feeling better ever since.

g7f2n4,2020-04-24 15:40:00 UTC,"43 year old male.  i tested positive today.  now that tests are more plentiful, i finally decided to see if i had it.  i'm now in my 5th week since this all began.  i feel much much better.  just minor lingering symptoms remain at random times.  it's been very odd.  on and off symptoms at varying degrees of intensity.  here are my symptoms below:

it started in early march with back pain.  fairly bad back pain with what felt like tingling electrical pulses.  mid back to left of spine.  it made my limbs feel weak.  at one point, while sitting on the couch, i got up and fell to the floor.  my leg fell asleep without the trademark tingling or feel you are used to.  no warning..leg was dead and down i went.  i was concerned and figured i'd monitor things.  

after a few days of the back pain, it slowly lessened and i began to get a horrible headache.  all on the left side of my head.  it made me want to vomit.  this headache lasted 3 days.  i had no other symptoms at this time

around week into this, i began to feel overwhelming fatigue.  so, at this point, no back pain, no headache.  just fatigue.  it seems i get one symptom at a time to deal with..at high intensity.  

the fatigue lasted a couple weeks...in during the time, i began to feel intermittent shortness of breath.  no cough.  no fever.  just fatigue and trouble breathing.

during the 3re week, i finally developed a fever.  very low grade.  it never hit 100.  i felt very hot, but the thermometer never went as high as i felt.  the fatigue lasted throughout and in also got nausea and stomach pain.

during the last two weeks, daily, i may feel a brief fever, i may get a headache, i may feel shortness of breath...may also feel fine.  thing come and go.  weak and strong.  it doesnt make much sense.  but, today the test revealed this was all covid-19.  i assume this is what they call a mild case.  its was worse than any flu, but i'm happy i was not crushed with multiple symptoms all at once the whole time.  the virus picked and chose what i would receive at different times.  over a month of misery in all and i'm still not better.  this is evil stuff my friends",$$$but$$$degrees$$$head$$$but$$$leg$$$fever$$$leg$$$overwhelming$$$headache$$$but$$$mid$$$headache$$$stomach$$$weak$$$weak$$$breath$$$fatigue$$$fever$$$fatigue$$$fever$$$sitting$$$cough$$$fatigue$$$headache$$$headache$$$fatigue$$$breathing$$$fatigue$$$nausea$$$sense$$$breath$$$whole$$$,"$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Headache$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Fatigue$$$Fatigue$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Headache$$$Headache$$$Fatigue$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Nausea$$$Anosmia$$$Dyspnea$$$Body ache & Pain$$$",$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C1832070$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0018681$$$C0011991$$$C0015672$$$C0015672$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C0018681$$$C0018681$$$C0015672$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0027497$$$C0003126$$$C0013404$$$C0741585$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
g7fld0,2020-04-24 16:08:00 UTC,"iâ€™m mostly posting this for documentation, especially since i started off with extremely mild symptoms. also just so thereâ€™s more info out there!

symptoms started april 13/14, tested april 18 and today got positive results. 

started as a dry cough, headaches,sore throat, and burning sensation in chest. some trouble breathing but chalked it up to anxiety. light heart palpitations.

progressed to less coughing and less dry throat. can still feel some discomfort when i inhale deeply, like a sore throat but in my chest. one day with low grade fever and occasionally getting night sweats. 

my biggest issue now is iâ€™ve been extremely nauseous! for about 3 days now. i also can barely taste anything.

overall very mild case. about my health: 25, asthmatic, non smoker, slightly overweight.

what iâ€™ve been treating symptoms with: smokers tea, ginger tea, mucinex(suppressant), lots of vitamins and probiotics, humidifier, coconut water, aspirin for heart and pain.

i prepped really hard for this because of my asthma and because a relative ended up with covid related pneumonia, so that may have helped keep my symptoms mild?

my initial biggest complaint was a horrible headache which has left.  now i have this constant burning in my chest/sternum area.  it burns more when i talk or sit up. my chest feels kinda heavy and sore- like someone punched me and my diaphragm area also feels sore. all of that said, i have no real shortness of breath and my o2 is staying between 96-99 (got a pulse oximeter before all of this). honestly minus my chest being on red hot fire and heavy,  i feel okay.  i've definitely felt worse in the past with the flu or pneumonia.  
 so what i'm wondering is if anyone else has experienced this burning chest and had it get better or did it continue to get worse? is it an early symptom of something more concerning? ultimately i know y'all aren't doctors and i'm awaiting mine to call me back but i thought it could be helpful to get some perspective from individuals who have gone through something similar.  hope y'all get to feeling better soon and thanks!",$$$burning$$$similar$$$headache$$$something$$$but$$$headache$$$throat$$$thought$$$pneumonia$$$something$$$burning$$$but$$$before$$$breath$$$,$$$Chest pain$$$Chest pain$$$Headache$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Headache$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$other$$$Chest tightness$$$Chest pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Dyspnea$$$,$$$C0008031$$$C0008031$$$C0018681$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0000000$$$C0235710$$$C0008031$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0013404$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

i first noticed something was off on the 17th march. scratchy feeling at the back of my throat, uncomfortable post-nasal drip. i self-isolated after then. had an intermittent cough. i feared i infected my 77 year old father too with no way to live in separate houses, so that made me feel anxious and depressed, presumably worsening my symptoms. (he is now into exactly 3 weeks of mild symptoms - eye pressure and phlegm still; fever, cough have subsided, so has loss of appetite which he had in his first week of overt symptoms)

i had a fever, a mild cough, a runny nose, and a throat that was sore only on one side but by far my worst symptoms were the horrid ammonia smell and dehydration, plus loss of appetite. i also feel some discomfort in my chest, especially when i lie down. some aches and pains here and there, which come and go. now, the symptoms seem milder, but i'm still congested with (mild) shortness of breath and mucus. still keeping a vigil for my dad too; even though we're both well past the 5-10 days post-onset where people seem to most often deteriorate, i'm concerned about the possibility of sudden worsening symptoms and continued recurrence. been dosing on vitamin c, d, zinc, and expectorant, but i know that can only go so far.

i am experiencing bad insomnia. my mind isnt shutting off, i cannot sleep my body needs to be dead tired to even sleep for 1-2 hours a day. i suffer from sleep apnea as well. i keep overthinking and i cant sleep at all. i think ive only gotten about 7-8 hours of sleep this past week

its been a week, my sense of taste and smell is back but its hard for me to breathe. i randomly get attacks of severe shortness of breath in the morning at the same time for the past 3 days. i drink alot of water, eat foods with vitamin c and try to rest after. ive also been experiencing bad insomnia and havent slept properly since ive gotten tested. my chest is tight and it feels like its burning, so do my ears (they're blocked along with bad nasal congestion) my eyes feel like they arent there at all. has anyone else experienced this? i feel like my symptoms are getting worse and im scared my organs are gonna fail and die any second. i need some words to help me...",$$$breathe$$$thought$$$burning$$$taste$$$ears$$$breathing$$$eat$$$sense$$$but$$$sleep$$$coughing$$$came$$$tired$$$ocassional coughing$$$sense$$$tight$$$taste$$$sleep$$$theyre$$$pounds$$$sleep$$$nasal$$$scared$$$sleep$$$ears$$$sinus$$$sleep$$$breathe$$$smell$$$eyes$$$slept$$$breath$$$,"$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest pain$$$Ageusia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Loss of appetite$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Anosmia$$$Chest tightness$$$Ageusia$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Rhinorrhea$$$other$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Dyspnea$$$Anosmia$$$Eye pain$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Dyspnea$$$",$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0008031$$$C2364111$$$C0013456$$$C0013404$$$C0232462$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0917801$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0003126$$$C0235710$$$C2364111$$$C0917801$$$C1260880$$$C0000000$$$C0917801$$$C1260880$$$C1832070$$$C0917801$$$C0013456$$$C0948596$$$C0917801$$$C0013404$$$C0003126$$$C0151827$$$C0917801$$$C0013404$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

g84af7,2020-04-25 20:05:00 UTC,"i am 37 yr old female. i got sick march 20th.
my doctor first told me it's just a common cold and gave me a cough medicine.
but i started vomiting. my doctor wasn't available, so a different doctor gave me some pills for nausea.

then a week later i got sicker. i looked terrible. every joints in my body was hurting. i was coughing blood up.
my doctor gave me zpak. nothing happened. i started hearing metal scratching noise from my windpipe every time i blow out a breath. my doctor didn't really believe that. i guess he's never experienced it so he probably didn't know you could hear it yourself.

anyways, my doctor gave me oral steroids. and by now i had horrible shortness of breath already, so he also gave me an inhaler to use as needed. it didn't really help though.
i thought i was dying. every inch of my body hurt. i wanted to go to a hospital, but i didn't want to go a place full of covid-19. 

by the end of the second week, my doctor discussed with some other doctors at his practice, and decided to send me to get tested. i went the next day, it was positive. i was sent for an xray the day after. i had pneumonia.
i wanted to die. everything was painful. and knowing that there's no cure made the pain worse. i started thinking about death in more detail. i contacted a local medical school which i had arranged to donate my body after i'm gone, and told them i have covid. they said they couldn't except my body anymore. that was very depressing. 

on the third week, my doctor said ""you have pneumonia. what do you think? do you want another rounds of antibiotics?"" i sensed the uncertainty from his voice. but i had no other choice just like he didn't have any other option. so i said sure.
he gave me a different kind of antibiotics this time, and the oral steroids again. and he also gave me a steroid inhaler to use twice a day. he tried to send me to the er once, but the ambulance came to my house to tell me the hospitals are full. by the end of the 3rd week, i didn't get better at all. and my doctor admitted he didn't know what to do anymore. he called a pulmonologist onto my case.

this lung doctor didn't know shit either, obviously. but now they were discussing with more doctors and finally decided to give me hydroxychloroquine which he told me before that it was only for inpatients at the hospitals. my doc also gave me clonazepam to let me calm, but very low dose because apparently i could stop functioning.
the lung doctor told me to sleep with my head higher than the heart. and also on my stomach. ðÿ™„ so....... i just ignored it.

another week passed.

and now i have an oxygen concentrator a home the pulmonologist prescribed. i'm on it 24 hours. they also gave me the oxygen tanks to use when i go outside, but i'm like, outside? hello i'm being quarantined.

my doctor told me they will test me for the antibody in 2-3 weeks. then they will know if i still have either active coronavirus or the antibody. that's when he will tell me if i could step outside of the house or not.

this has been hard especially because my husband was still going to work when i was in the most pain, and i had to care for our baby. then he also became positive. although he was sick only for 2 weeks, it was a hell trying to look after the 11 month old baby while we both have a very contagious, possibly deadly virus.

luckily the baby never got sick, and it's going to be his first birthday on 30th.
my husband is back to work so it will be me and the baby. we are not allowed invite anyone into this house. so yup. at least he's so young that he won't remember it, right?

i have been battling a respiratory infection since march. i have been unable to get tested because they are not doing any general tests.

started off as a dry cough and quickly turned into a productive one. within 2 weeks i was wheezing and having chest pains. 

went to the doctor where they didn't do any tests and prescribed me steroids. well that didn't work and my symptoms were just as bad, spitting up phlegm, fatigue and chest pains - although no fever.

around week four i try to go see the doctor again, but they are not seeing any patients with respiratory symptoms. i end up having 10 days of antibiotics given to me which reduces the phlegm in a big way. 

now on like week five and a week after the antibiotics i'm getting bouts of chest tightness and some lingering pangs in my left lung it seems. doc said over the phone that it's my small airways that are clogged and gave me a puffer although i have reacted bad with that (rapid heart rate, weekness)

my lord, i have never had an illness that has taken so much out of me for so long. for as 27 year old dude that likes fitness this put my world on hold. don't know if i should be demanding an xray or riding it out. hard when clinics don't even want to see you...

i know sheâ€™s positive and to be quite honest i know she sort of blames me for bringing it in the house. the first few days i kept asking if she needed to see the doctor because sheâ€™s around 53 and has diabetes so it could be hard for her. 

she kept saying sheâ€™s getting better and it seemed like she was. yesterday she was laughing on the phone, today it sounded like her voice had lots of mucus in when she talks. i hear her dry cough occasionally but itâ€™s not constant. today, her face seemed redder as well but she says she can breathe okay still, just looks extremely tired. 

she must be on around day 10-12 or so, taking medication (mucinex) and zinc as well. she wonâ€™t really respond to me with a straight answer when i ask if sheâ€™s getting better or worse...because itâ€™s on and off sometimes now. i donâ€™t know if this is a mild or severe case still. my uncleâ€™s friend tested positive at the hospital, spent his last 2 weeks in icu and was gone that fast.

iâ€™m holding onto some hope that if she was very severe we wouldâ€™ve known by now. but realistically i canâ€™t tell if her getting worse today will be downhill from here on out. i feel so incredibly guilty for bringing it home from a patient, even though she warned me to not go to work for a bit. it was too late by the time i asked off.

two weeks ago i had an antibody test done at an independent lab, it was basically just a yes/no igg/igm test. i tested negative for the antibodies, and positive for the igm which is basically the result you would get at the beginning of an illness and certainly not a month out. i followed up with my doctor to see what she though, she said that she couldn't rule out that i was still contagious a month later since i had igm showing up, but it's hard to tell because the test that i took was very yes/no and they have a higher fail rate. 

today i took another antibody test through my doctor, this was a full blood draw that is being sent to the lab and it will show actual levels not just yes/no. i scared and excited to know. i realize antibodies do not mean immune especially since so much is unknown about the virus, but i'm going to feel a lot better if i have them since i will consider myself recovered by that point, at the bare minimum i don't want to have igm showing up again, that thought that a person can be infectious 1 month out is scary.

monday 4/20, at work, i would have these moments of severe exhaustion that would come and go throughout the day. 

tuesday 4/21, i still had those weird exhausting periods that came and went. i felt almost like i took a bunch of xanax or something - like severely tired for a minute and then back to normal. then about midday that day, i developed body aches and 99.5 temp and was sent home from work.

g9ao75,2020-04-27 18:11:00 UTC,"posting from a /r/nyc thread:

>march 15th: ""i got a cold"" feeling kicked in.

>march 18th: ""okay this doesn't seem like a typical cold""

>march 20th: started feeling ill.

>march 23rd: headache, nausea, productive cough with brown specks, sore throat, burning nasal passages, eyes felt sore in the back.

>march 28th: headaches at the base of neck and frontal lobe, sinus pain (dryness feeling), chest tightness (but i didn't have trouble breathing), loss of taste and smell.

>march 30th: called hotline to setup appointment, after having a coughing fit and felt and heard an audible ""pop"" from my left chest.

>april 3rd: went to the er for them to take my vitals and the attending nurse tells me ""why are you even here, just go home. all that ""just wanting to find out shit doesn't apply here"". <went home>

>april 5th: went back to er when i spit up some blood, x-rays showed no bad signs in lungs, they didn't check for anything else i mentioned and put me down as upper respiratory issues, marked me as possible covid-19 but didn't test.

>april 8th: finally get tested at one of the drive thru centers. still felling malaise. headaches slowed down, appetite slowly returning. digestive issues start to appear. constipation, constantly dull gurgling from all quadrants of abdominal area. found multiple blood bubbles in my mouth, two of which just popped when i saw them, and touched with tongue to see what it was.

>april 11th: positive results for test, still feeling sick. abdominal pain alternates dull/sharp in lower abdomen.

>april 15th: pain radiates to lower back on the flanks, lower back pain that i've had kicks into overdrive. upper back feels sore like strained muscles. headaches back with vengeance, feeling tired/sleepy more. drink prune juice to clear constipation.

>april 18th: retested for covid-19, back to er as chest got way tighter then before and i was worried. diagnosed with gastrointestinal problems. told to take peptide to stop diarrhea. (mixed messages here from medical personnel)

>april 22: results now say presumed positive. stomach still cramping up when i sit, lay, walk. eating pastas before wakes me up with a headache, coffee helps alleviate it when i wake up.

since my last hospital visit, when i was told of my blood pressure being high (158/111), i cut back on high salts foods and gluten based foods and dont eat 3 hours before bedtime. thankfully by doing this i no longer wake up with a splitting headaches.

the aliments currently plaguing me after all the standard covid-19 symptoms is inflammation and abdominal pains and mild lower-back pains (from left side flank to right side flank). urinating much more than often and insomnia. 

back to the inflammation, my elbows, knees, center of my chest and upper-back all feel inflamed. (tylenol does nothing for this) the pulsing down my left/right arm and left shoulder and both legs. 

my main concern in the pulsating throbbing feeling in my legs and arms which i have also felt on my lower shoulder where the axillary artery, but only this one when i was gaming and my heart started beating faster. is i'm 213lb - starter the isolation at 235lb. 

i should go to the er i'm thinking but i'm tired of being sent away without the proper diagnostics, which has happened twice already. maybe it's anxiety.

g9bhhm,2020-04-27 18:58:00 UTC,thursday i started to feel tired at work and a bit off.  friday i started to get the chills at work.  saturday i felt fine and did a lot of physical activity.  last night i couldn't sleep and had a pounding headache and a slight cough.  i went to the testing site by my house and they said i'm positive.  i don't feel too bad.  i was actually able to walk on my treadmill.  the 99.2 fever bothers me and the slight cough.  hopefully it doesn't get worse.  what im trying to figure out is the lady at the clinic said i can return to work 14 days after my symptoms began.  i was panicking so i wasn't able to ask questions.  the thing is is that 14 days from lastthursday or fourteen days from today?  i hope i am ok.  im overweight in my 30s. i plan on getting to test that say negative for when i return to work if all goes well.,$$$cough$$$headache$$$chills$$$sleep$$$tired$$$pounding headache$$$fever$$$cough$$$goes$$$,$$$Cough$$$Headache$$$Chills$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Fatigue$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Palpitations$$$,$$$C0010200$$$C0018681$$$C0085593$$$C0917801$$$C0015672$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0030252$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
g9c3lx,2020-04-27 19:35:00 UTC,"**wow this turned out to be way longer than i thought. tdlr at the bottom.**

a little about me: 26 year old female, bmi of 17.4 (underweight). possible risk factors include: low body weight (thanks, rona), congenital long qt syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and low blood pressure. tested positive for covid on april 3rd.

so i'm not exactly sure when i contracted covid. i'm either 61 or 45 days into this, as you'll see below.

on february 26th i went to my doctor with complaints of a low grade fever and scratchy throat. at that time there were zero confirmed cases of the virus in my city, but i was concerned due to the nature of my job. (i work face-to-face with visitors at my city's largest library. the library itself is one of the most popular tourist attractions in town, so i spend a lot of time with international travelers.) my doctor wanted to test me, but due to strict cdc guidelines, it couldn't happen.

from february 26th to march 8th, my symptoms stayed the same, but my low grade fever was inching up (99.7f). my doctor reached out to me and told me i should try to get tested for covid now. so i set up an after hours appointment with a different doctor who would screen me before administering the test. except... she didn't think i had it because i hadn't left the country, so no test for me.

i should say that i stopped going to work february 26th due to my anxiety about covid. from february 26th to march 13th the only times i left the house were to get groceries (wore mask + glasses), visit my family, and see my cardiologist. i say this because if i really was sick with covid during this time, it would be really strange for none of my family members to show symptoms (some have health risks). to this day, my family members haven't shown any symptoms. also, i live with my boyfriend and he hasn't shown any symptoms either.

on march 13th i had an appointment with my cardiologist. this is where i think i might have picked up covid if i didn't already have it. i wore a mask and glasses inside the clinic and stayed away from other patients. some were coughing (probably heart failure), and i didn't want any part of that. a tech ran an ekg on me, and my cardiologist ordered an echocardiogram to be administered that same day since my last one was outdated. this made me anxious because 1) of how intimate ultrasounds can be and 2) the lack of masks being worn by staff members. no one was wearing a mask! i told them i would be waiting outside in the fresh air while they got things ready for my echocardiogram. when i was getting the echo done, i kept my mask and glasses on. the tech and i were talking about covid and how no one is really taking it seriously, and at one point she coughs into her elbow. i must have looked like i saw a ghost because she then told me ""oh no, i don't have it."" *hmm...* anyway, after my cardiologist appointment i went home. 

my boyfriend and i have not left our apartment since march 13th (45 days now). i've only left to go to the er and hospital.

from march 13th to april 2nd, my symptoms started to get worse. my low grade fevers were now approaching 100.0f every evening, my throat was super scratchy, my nose was congested, and i was having bouts of diarrhea. i contacted my doctor again on april 2nd, and she requested i get a covid test. the next day i received the test at a drive-thru test site attached to my doctor's clinic. on april 5th, i found out i was positive. that was also the day my temperature finally reached 100.4f.

on april 8th i went to the er because my heart rate was ~160bpm walking to the bathroom, my pulse ox was low that morning, and i was having some burning chest pains. they didn't even take me inside the hospital; instead, they did an ekg and x-ray in the ambulance bay. when both of those came back clear, they told me to go home and work on my anxiety.

on april 13th i went back to the same er due to chest pain and shortness of breath. this time they actually took me to a room and did an ekg, x-ray, and some bloodwork. the ekg and bloodwork came back okay, but the x-ray showed possible pneumonia in my lower right lung. they didn't prescribe me anything for the pneumonia, so i called my doctor who prescribed me doxycycline. i finished my prescription on april 25th.

on april 16th i had an appointment to get more bloodwork done at my doctor's clinic, but my doctor ended up sending me to the hospital afterwards. she was concerned about my heart possibly being infected. i was admitted to the hospital overnight so they could observe me and administer antibiotics in case i did have a secondary infection. my vitals were normal except for some tachycardia (~130bpm). they ran a bunch of tests on my heart including a few ekgs and an echocardiogram. those came back normal. they also took another x-ray which also came back normal despite the nurse hearing some wheezing in my right lung. all of my bloodwork came back normal, but i was concerned about some of the wbc counts. apparently i was the only one worried, so they discharged me the evening of april 17th.

so i've been back at home since april 17th. there were a few days last week when i didn't have a low grade fever, and it was awesome. i thought i was finally over all this! except that didn't last for long, and my temperature has been elevated again (99.7-100f). i've also noticed some skin conditions popping up this week: [red fingertips](https://imgur.com/a/ignrxyg) and a [red livedo reticularis-like discoloration](https://imgur.com/a/vautytu) on my forearms. low blood pressure on april 25th and 26th (~92/65). my pulse ox has been 96-99% when resting, but i do notice some mild sob while talking. tachycardia is also back as of this morning. 

i'm really concerned about the possibility this could get worse. i feel lucky that i didn't have the coughing and breathing issues at the beginning of my illness, but now i'm concerned it might happen. also reading that covid can cause blood clots is just so scary. i know that i'm pretty far into this by now, but i can't help but worry it will get worse. i want to get a ct scan of my chest, but iâ€™m also scared by what it might show.

**tldr: i've had covid for either 61 days or 45 days. new symptoms are popping up, and old symptoms are returning. i'm worried it will get worse despite being past the two week mark.**

g9cntj,2020-04-27 20:09:00 UTC,"asking for my mom who just got a test today. i am positive and she said sheâ€™s been feeling sick a few days right after me.

iâ€™m recovered; iâ€™m young and only lost my senses which came back. however, she is diabetic in her 50s. i noticed she seemed like she had a cold the first few days, generally tired and had a mild dry cough. perhaps day 4-5 she had some nasal congestion. at this time she was still pretty much doing normal things, talking and laughing on the phone etc.

she said her worst was maybe 4 days ago (so perhaps day 10-11) with muscle aches and fatigue. her face was red and she just looked tired. she didnâ€™t have shortness of breath and could still talk to me fine, but she felt like she had a fever. 

so today close to 2 weeks into symptoms, we got her a test since i was positive and most likely she is. i asked her if she needed to see the online doctor and she said she feels way better. barely any cough, she said even if she saw the online doctor thereâ€™s truly no ongoing symptoms *at the moment* she could give him. if anything, she just still feels slightly tired but the muscle aches are not intense. i even bought a pulse oximeter but she is still breathing normally and says it hasnâ€™t been an issue yet. 

iâ€™m being optimistic but still anticipating the worst because iâ€™m not truly sure if itâ€™s gonna get worse even after she feels better today. the test will probably still be positive.

i canâ€™t tell if sheâ€™s on the way to recovery since i had the most mild symptoms iâ€™m not too sure how to compare my recovery to hers. doctor kept telling me if it was very severe weâ€™d know by now, since itâ€™s over a week into the illness. iâ€™m just crazy scared tomorrow or the next day things will be different or bad symptoms will return. i never had fatigue but she did so iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s still considered mild. 

has anyone genuinely felt like they got very better and then got way worse? what days did you experience the worst symptoms? weâ€™ve been told usually around day 10 youâ€™d know if it was very bad. but my mom is bad at keeping track of her symptoms, and i canâ€™t do plenty to help her bc iâ€™m isolating as well. only person who doesnâ€™t seem like they have symptoms is my dad which iâ€™m monitoring. i gave it to them, and i only lost my taste and smell. i didnâ€™t have respiratory problems, not even a cough, but i assume itâ€™s bc iâ€™m young and my system battled it off faster. she still has her senses. 



tldr; annoying the fuck out of my mom because iâ€™m scared she will need help but she says she feels fine. she felt very fatigue just 3 days ago, face red, etc. today we got her a test (prob positive) but she says she feels way better and fine. no shortness of breath, constant cough, or major respiratory symptoms seen. should i be anticipating other major symptoms to come back after â€œgoodâ€ days with mild symptoms? we are all taking zinc",$$$fatigue$$$but$$$respiratory$$$but$$$tired$$$breath$$$but$$$fever$$$cough$$$scared$$$respiratory$$$but$$$muscle$$$talking$$$tired$$$cough$$$breathing$$$muscle$$$but$$$but$$$but$$$cough$$$breath$$$fatigue$$$fatigue$$$cough$$$but$$$taste$$$scared$$$came$$$but$$$tired$$$nasal$$$smell$$$,"$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Myalgia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Myalgia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Ageusia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Anosmia$$$",$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C1832070$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0231528$$$C2363731$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0231528$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C2364111$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C1260880$$$C0003126$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
g9d8x3,2020-04-27 20:45:00 UTC,"hi i would like to share my symptom timeline, itâ€™s different than many media symptom reports. more like a classic sars1 white paper symptom timeline.â i am a 28 year old runner without any pre existing conditions 

i probably got covid19 it on a buisness trip in nyc but i didnâ€™t experience symptoms until i flew back to my home state

mid march, day 1: sore throat and runny nose

day 2: low grade fever 99.9 and sore throat runny nose

day 3: low grade fever 99.9 and sore throat and runny nose

day 4: fever gone. shortness of breath/dyspnea and costochronditis hit me like a train. i immediately knew this was covid. called a teledoc doctor and he said since i was in nyc early march itâ€™s definitely covid19

day 5: dyspnea gets worse. i feel like i am always running. not hungry at all. lost all appetite until day 20ish. i always cough after eating from this day forward. i rarely cough otherwise. i sneeze now everyday from from here on out at least once.â 

day 6: shortness of breath keeps getting worse. i feel like i am always swimming in the ocean. i want a break but i have to keep swimming. i cannot talk for long without being out of breath while i have dyspneaâ 

day 7: i get a pulse oximeter ordered from amazon. 96% and pulse 100+. still dyspnea and chest painâ 

day 8: i go into urgent care with dyspnea and a n95 mask. i felt like i was suffocating with that mask. xray ekg and o2 and pulse measured. clear chest xray. doc thinks i dont have covid19 but anxiety. he only gives it to me because of nyc travel. i go home. doc says if spo2 goes below 94% go to er

day 9-13: dyspnea. i feel like i am suffocating. i found i have to sleep upright sitting or on my stomach to be able to sleep and breath. i continue to do this even today to relieve chest pain

day 14: i am an active runner that enjoys being out of breath but not like this. i have run marathons but this feels like 4 marathons in a row every day with no breaks. my spo2 is 95-96%. test comes back positive for sars-cov-2/covid19.â 

day 15:still dyspnea and chest pain. i did not think i was going to survive this. a lot of physical and emotional sufferingâ 

day 16: teledoc doc recommendeds i go to er for blood work and checkup for myocarditis and rule out bacterial lung infection or other idiopathic infections. i decide to go to er. it was the first time i saw the light of day after many days of quarantine. i get ct scan of heart lungs and bloodwork. only have covid19 infection. i have a mild problem with my heart. clear chest ct scan. test positive for covid19 again. they give me the option to be in patient and be monitored. i decide to be discharged from hospital to prevent a potential nosocomial infectionâ â 

day 17-20: dyspnea/shortness of breath is the worst it has ever been. spo2% still above 95%

day 21: dyspnea fades quickly and i can talk again. pulse goes from 100ish to 70ish. costochrondritis is still present with headaches. it feels like someone hit me in the chest with a baseball bat. it feels like real trauma.â 

day 21-day 30 costochrondritis is painful and unrelenting. i sleep 10-15 hours a day. i look forward to sleeping to null pain. i do not take any anti inflammatory for fear of side affects.

day 30-35 current: costochrondritis is slowly getting better. pulse is 50-60. i have headaches still everyday. i ordered a neck collar off amazon that helps with my neck position when i sleep upright and helps take off some headache pain

day 36: i decide to go for a run because i am worried i have pah or pvod. i can run which is a good sign. i get shortness of breath when i get back to my car and rest.

day 37: all the symptoms come back probably due to running. runny nose ,sore throat, etc decide to take it easy today

day 38: i feel like pre running days. chest pain and headaches. i have lost around 25 pounds since day 1

â i called a doctor and he has ordered blood work. i have a referral to see a cardiologist for a echo-cardiogram to see if i have pah or pvod. doctor also ordered another covid test to see if i am still positive. he suspects i might still be fighting the virus due to my symptom flare up. i would also like to test negative before seeing cardiologist in person for tests. he will order antibodies test in the futureâ 

i am not a doctor. this is not medical advice and seek a health professional. these tips are my opinion only and not to be taken as facts:

tips for others

â 1 get a spo2 monitor and temperature.â 

2 always check your o2 and temperature everyday.â 

3 sleep upright in a sitting position with a neck cast or collar, or sleep on your stomach. do not sleep on your back or side

4 have heard sleep apnea devices can help get you more oxygen without a ventilator and can monitor your o2 levels while you sleep. i wish i had one. i would wake up choking out of breath at night and i think i was lucky to keep above 95% o2 without checking myself while i slept

5 multivitamin with vitamin d everyday

6 sleep without an alarm clock. take time off from work if you need to

7 get blood work done if you can after being cleared from quarantine to check for d dimer blood clotting, bnp, metabolic panel, c reactive protien, etc.â 

i am grateful others post here because i feel i am not alone that others experience symptoms for so long. i had the flu a few years ago and i was over it in 4 days. sars-cov-2 has taken me almost 10 times as long and i am still not recoveredâ ",$$$pounds$$$headaches$$$breath$$$nose$$$throat$$$worried$$$sleep$$$state$$$keeps$$$breath$$$everyday$$$sleeping$$$but$$$everyday$$$runny nose$$$goes$$$look$$$headache$$$sleep$$$breath$$$throat$$$stomach$$$neck$$$breath$$$sleep$$$grade fever$$$throat$$$before$$$sleep$$$nose$$$runny nose$$$headaches$$$choking$$$breath$$$but$$$low grade fever$$$but$$$neck$$$stomach$$$sleep$$$but$$$goes$$$breaks$$$fever$$$appetite$$$sleep$$$sitting$$$sleep$$$fever$$$temperature$$$everyday$$$headaches$$$mid$$$nose$$$anxiety$$$cough$$$sleep$$$levels$$$nose$$$sleep$$$painful$$$breath$$$sneeze$$$breath$$$sitting$$$low grade fever$$$cough$$$alone$$$hungry$$$sleep$$$grade fever$$$runny nose$$$runny nose$$$slept$$$fever$$$breath$$$throat$$$but$$$sleep hours$$$neck$$$,"$$$other$$$Headache$$$Dyspnea$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Abdominal pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Palpitations$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Headache$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Dyspnea$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Headache$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Loss of appetite$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Chest tightness$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Headache$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$other$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Chest pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Sneezing$$$Dyspnea$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Loss of appetite$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Body ache & Pain$$$",$$$C0000000$$$C0018681$$$C0013404$$$C1260880$$$C2363731$$$C1832070$$$C0917801$$$C0012833$$$C0000737$$$C0013404$$$C1832070$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C1260880$$$C0030252$$$C0741585$$$C0018681$$$C0917801$$$C0013404$$$C2363731$$$C0011991$$$C0741585$$$C0013404$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0013456$$$C0917801$$$C1260880$$$C1260880$$$C0018681$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0011991$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0232462$$$C0917801$$$C0235710$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0018681$$$C0741585$$$C1260880$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0917801$$$C0000000$$$C1260880$$$C0917801$$$C0008031$$$C0013404$$$C0037383$$$C0013404$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C0232462$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C1260880$$$C1260880$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0917801$$$C0741585$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

g9g3jg,2020-04-27 23:55:00 UTC,"hey everyone, first off, a little background. 27m, moderately healthy, played sports for years prior to this but was sedentary for the half a year prior to covid pandemic. smoker, but quit right when i felt symptoms.

so i was tested on 3/25, went into urgent care with a shortness of breath and chest tightness. positive result came back 4/4.

the whole time, i had shortness of breath, chest tightness, fatigue, aches all over and weird heart rate problem. 

iâ€™m currently in week 5, with shortness of breath and sharp chest pain that comes and goes. frequency is a lot shorter than the first few weeks for sure. it last for hours daily instead of just being constant now. 

in between that 5 weeks, iâ€™ve went into urgent care 4 times(?).with two x rays, one at week 1 and one at the end of week 4, and did 2 ekg and everything came back normal. no pneumonia, nothing. the pain and aches in my chest were pretty painful though, as well as the shortness of breath. there were quite a lot of nights where i really didnâ€™t sleep well tbh in fear of just not breathing.

iâ€™m just wondering if anyone else have the same thing as me, and if so, what did your doctor said or suspect is going on in your chest? the doctors never said anything except that itâ€™s inflammation and itâ€™s healing.

side note, i have lower blood pressure and heart rate  as well throughout this whole thing, diastolic always within low 60s and at times 58-59. anyone else?

ok throat pain never lasted more than 3 days in my life, this is not the cold, nor dengue or the flu cause they hit harder.

i wondering if any of you have recieved a diagnosis of post viral inflammation to explain and lingering symptoms of chest pain. 

i have been battling respiratory issues since the beginning of march. what started off as a dry cough soon morphed to a phlegmy one. i was unable to get tests as there are not available. i did get antibiotics which i finished 12 days ago. phlegm is by and large gone although i have had lingering chest issues.

i have been experiencing chest pain and tightness since the antibiotics. a doctor i spoke over the phone told me it is a result of post viral inflammation and prescribed me a budesonide inhaler.

he said that these pains can take weeks to subside. **has anyone dealt with this?**

it is rather is rather unsettling as i have not really had any hands in diagnostics. **how long did these symptoms last for you? anything that helped you?**

first had symptoms on march 18.
started out with aches and feeling tired.
couple of days later aches were worse, stayed in bed, very flu like.
this carried on for a week, then the aches went but still felt tired, weak and started coughing.

9 days in most of it in bed, coughing, weak, worse at night. then felt something bad had happened to my left lung, felt tight, wasn't breathing too well.
phoned an ambulance.

went to hospital, had an x-ray and a swab test for covid-19. doctor and nurses said looking at my x-ray and symptoms it was very likely i had covid-19. admitted to hospital for covid-19 and pnuemonia, was on a drip for 3 days, and oxygen mask for 5.
discharged on the afternoon of the 5 day.

at home couldn't do very much at all.
had continuous coughing fits when standing up or moving around, very breathless and weak stayed in bed.
second day at home had a weird feeling in my right lower leg. felt very tight, couldn't move it, sent back to hospital. i had dvt, sent home with medicine.

gradually got better over the next two weeks. less coughing, not as breathless, still couldn't stand or move for that long. but sitting in a chair rather than bed. improving every day.

24 april sent to hospital for a chest x-ray
x-ray showed still quite a lot of stuff on my left lung, need to go back for another x-ray in 4 weeks, hopefully it will be clearer.

last few days, moving around a lot more, coughing a lot less. going outside for 10-15 minute walks. improving everyday. still got quite a way to get  back to normal, but going in the right direction.",$$$tight$$$weak$$$coughing$$$leg$$$coughing fits$$$breathless$$$breathless$$$but$$$coughing$$$something$$$tired$$$breathing$$$tight$$$sitting$$$weak$$$stand$$$tired$$$coughing$$$weak$$$but$$$but$$$everyday$$$coughing$$$coughing$$$,"$$$Chest tightness$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Chest tightness$$$Fatigue$$$Dyspnea$$$Chest tightness$$$Chest tightness$$$Fatigue$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$",$$$C0235710$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0741585$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0235710$$$C0015672$$$C0013404$$$C0235710$$$C0235710$$$C0015672$$$C0012833$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

my mom, however, just tested positive yesterday. i would say sheâ€™s about day 6-7 in. just some fatigue, no shortness of breath, and a mild cough. she had on and off days of symptoms, but her most present symptom is tiredness. she has lots of underlying health conditions such as diabetes, so iâ€™m hoping it doesnâ€™t make a turn for the worst. 

now that she has tested positive, iâ€™m the one who usually helps her out because iâ€™ve already recovered. i gave her the virus sadly, and iâ€™m not sure if every time i am checking her temp or close to her, iâ€™m basically starting my virus cycle all over again or have any immunity.

before getting sick, my wife felt symptoms 10 days prior and tested positive. she then quarantined herself so i assume the incubation period for me was 10 days (though it is technically possible i caught it after she quarantined).

april 1: first day of symptoms as i felt a sudden onset of chills and that ""malaise"" feeling

april 2: had a fever at night of around 100 but tylenol took care of it.

april 3: actually started to feel better with mild symptoms

april 4: weird throat sensation (as if there was hair in my mouth) and lost sense of taste/smell

april 7-10: suddenly felt ill again, definitely worse than the onset.  fever, chills, fatigue, gi issues, body aches but no cough and very mild respiratory issues.

april 11-17: started to feel a bit better but still with the malaise.  i did feel i was able to work though not 100%.

april 18-24: started feeling noticeably better but still quite fatigued and a few ""bad"" days/waves mixed in. started getting sense of taste/smell back.

april 25-27: felt noticeably worse again, body aches, fatigue but not as sick as prior. at this point i was quite frustrated that i was unable to shake this thing as it was almost 4 weeks.

april 28-30 (today): noticeably improved and only symptom is the weird feeling in my throat.  much less fatigue too.  hopefully i am on the mend but the waves can come out of nowhere!

gbrnz7,2020-05-01 18:15:00 UTC,"33f, nonsmoker, very light/social drinker, daily cannabis user (strictly edibles). i'm in mostly good health though could definitely stand to lose a few pounds. i do 3-4 cardio (indoor cycling and walking outdoors/hiking) and lifting sessions a week.

day 1, saturday april 18: woke up with a slight headache, headache continued throughout the day. the headache almost felt like i'd been holding tension in my neck/jaw all day, towards the back of my skull. slight tickle in my throat and by 6pm deep breaths slightly uncomfortable but not unmanageable. no medication. 

day 2, sunday april 19th: slept well, woke up a bit hot but no temperature. sounds like i'm losing my voice but a hot shower helped. took 2 tylenol at 8:30am for headache. throughout the day i needed to clear my throat about every 10 minutes. slept from 10am-1pm. took another two tylenol at 5pm for headache and muscle soreness. lymph nodes possibly slightly swollen. before bed around 10:15pm i took 2 tylenol and 10ml dm.

day 3, monday april 20th: bad night of sleep, maybe slept from 1:30am-5am. woke up with  headache, mostly a dull ache behind my eyes. took temperature at 12:30pm, 99.9. at 1:30pm took 2 tylenol and 10ml dm. 9:15pm took 2 tylenol, 10ml dm, 10mg indica - no symptoms but needed to sleep well.

day 4, tuesday april 21st: slept about 6 hours. still feel like i'm about to get sick - keep clearing my throat. tongue feels like it was burned. more coughing in the morning than usual but nothing concerning. no chest tightness, no congestion. left shoulder blade sore but that's not atypical for me. had to drive to get tested and almost felt impaired. got home and had some disorientation and confusion.  boss told me to take the day off. took cbd/thc tincture are 10:30am. around 11:30am took 10mg hybrid and slept on and off from noon until 5pm. started to make dinner at 6pm exhausted by very little activity. have to sit down every few minutes, not shortness of breath but feels like i'm just not pulling in enough oxygen. by 6:30pm i let work know i wouldn't be in for the whole week. 2 tylenol at 6:30pm, developed low grade fever. sense of taste and smell seems to be unaffected in the evening. 7:45pm took 10ml dm. did breathing exercises and sleep meditation for around 15 minutes before falling asleep. 5mg indica for sleep.

day 5, wednesday april 22nd: woke up feeling very tired, weak and with lots of brain fog. went back to sleep until 10:30am. phone call confirmation of positive result. sitting up and reading/browsing is exhausting. took a shower at 11am, slightly short of breath. can't taste or smell anything. slept again 3pm-6:30pm. dinner of cold cure broth. tylenol at 7:30pm for severe muscle and joint aches. waves of intense nausea that dissipate just as quickly as they came on. at 10:30pm 5mg indica. 

day 6, thursday april 23rd: woke up feeling downright normal. slept all through the night until 7am. decided to try and get up and cook breakfast - made 2 scrambled eggs and coffee, by the time i finished one egg i was mid-chewing the second and was like, too tired to swallow. it was insane. spit it out and went back to bed, slept from 8-12:30pm.  around 7 felt like i developed a fever but checked and itâ€™s 98.6. took two tylenol got chills and possible developing fever. terrible night of sleep, insomnia and chills. stomach was growling before i fell asleep but too difficult to get up.

day 7, friday april 24th: bad night of sleep, took 2 tylenol at 3am for chills. fell back asleep around 5am, woke up at 9:30am. took 2 tylenol for chills. took a shower and had some cold cure broth, felt a lot better and got laundry and dishes done as well as took meals out of freezer to thaw. felt sick/chills/fever around 3 so slept from 3-6. felt a little better after eating and tylenol. at 8:30 felt good enough to bake bread, do dishes, thaw soup from freezer. for sleep and cough: 5mg indica, nyquil

day 8, saturday april 25th: slept 11 hours. woke up feeling exhausted but had to sit up. fell back asleep until 1pm. slight headache all day that tylenol didn't touch. 

day 9, sunday april 26th: slept 12 hours, mostly stayed in bed all day. body aches more intense and developed productive cough. no fever, chills. no appetite. severe it band and hip pain. 5mg indica and nyquil for cough.

day 10, monday april 27th: slept 8 hours, no symptoms.

my temp has been hanging out around 99.5-100.0f during the day, but falls to below 98.6f at night. it's been steadily getting higher each day.

my biggest issue now is major fatigue. iâ€™m sleeping tons, i guess because my body is now in repair mode instead of fight mode- at least thatâ€™s what iâ€™m hoping.

gc1apo,2020-05-02 01:45:00 UTC,"i've been the sickest i've ever been in my life at this point. please see my post history for a full run down of symptoms and progression but basically i'm still having lung attacks where i can't breath more than 20% capacity and my lungs feel like tire rubber. i'm also having neurological issues that have essentially left me feeling brain damaged. if you have an understanding of cfs/me symptoms; that's what i'm dealing with.

i'm unable to do anything but look after myself day to day. my business has gone out the window. i can't manage to get out to do shopping at this point because i'm so dizzy/confused, physically weak and breathless. 

yesterday i asked my doctor for a ct scan referal as my lungs have got worse in the last week after not improving but staying stable for a while. 52 days and i'm still struggling to breathe like 'i can't talk, need to save my breath' can't breathe for hours on end. the doctor refused to refer me. instead she would refer me to a 'medically unexplained illness clinic' ... essentially a mental health department with talking therapies. sorry, since when was being unable to breathe through physical ailments medically unexplainable?

the uk is rife with a lack of understanding and diamisal. comments like ""if you're under 45 you're fine. you'll experience a minor illness"". i'm 26 was previously working out 5x a week and counting my diet intake / macros. at a guess i'd say i was healthier than 70% of the general population in my age group so how can anyone assume long term saftey of any age at this point?

why is the media focusing on the mortality figure for the old and the infirm when it should be educating on the potential long term health risks to all ages. its leading to complacency in the younger demographic rather than adherence to self safety measures.

no, i dont want to breed fear, but a sense of blissful ignorance is not the answer; ignorance of the situation is how we got so deep into this mess in the first place. 

it's dangerous to minimise the severity of this illness for those infected who need support and validation to heal. it's also dangerous to encourage complacency in all ages in favour of a positivity bias. alot of people here in the uk are behaving as if this is nothing more than a minor ailment, it's shocking.

i'm tired of being personally ignored and hearing all ages of people laugh or downplay the dangers of this illness for the young and healthy when i'm sat here looking at a life that will never be what it could of been before i got infected. they have no idea how lucky they are to have good health! 

is anyone else experiencing the same dismissal and disbelief from those around them? 

is anyone else still going on 8+ weeks dealing with this?

edit: i wrote this yesterday morning. over night last night, i'm pretty sure i had a heart attack. i have no idea how i survived what ever it was. feel like i'd rather i didn't so i don't have to have another round of what ever that was.

it felt like boiling water being poured onto my heart. my heart now sounds like it's fluttering on some beats causing 3 contractions instead of 2. i can barely move but i'm scared to call for paramedics since when i did before they dismissed me and made me uncomfortable. no idea how i have made it through the night. the pain was like nothing i've ever felt before, would love access to some serious pain killers to make it a little easier.",$$$neurological$$$breath$$$weak$$$self$$$look$$$but$$$but$$$breathless$$$breathe$$$scared$$$but$$$before$$$breathe$$$tired$$$dizzy$$$sense$$$breathe$$$breath$$$before$$$talking$$$but$$$but$$$before$$$,"$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Anosmia$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$",$$$C0012833$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0012833$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0012833$$$C0003126$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0013456$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

last night, i got  this crazy feeling, extremely hard to breathe as i laid in bed. it felt like i was having an asthma attack. i checked the allergens (i suffer from seasonal allergies)  and nothing. but i did notice that there was a ozone warning in affect for 24 hours. i had never been affected by these ozone warnings, so this is a bit worrisome to me that all the sudden this is causing a full blown asthma attack. i was battling it most of the night and it was on and off through the day ...i went back to the nebulizer but itâ€™s not doing it much justice. has anyone else felt they may have turned more sensitive (or  even asthmatic) after having a severe battle with covid and recovering? anyone in the field have thoughts on this?

gc4z2u,2020-05-02 07:32:00 UTC,"(35f now on day 56) my timeline goes something like this:

february 28-29: probable exposure to virus on a long train ride and visit to the airport.

march 4: began self-isolating due to early recommendations for at-risk population.  (i'm asthmatic and i have antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which is an autoimmune disorder that causes blood clots.)

march 7: first started feeling a rattling in my right lung. lung felt congested but cough was unproductive. some wheezing, but didn't feel like an asthma attack. also experienced shortness of breath, headaches, muscle aches (chest and neck), fatigue (difficulty sitting up and staying awake), and nausea (did not throw up). symptoms continued and gradually worsened for over ten days. never developed a fever, as far as i can tell. treated symptoms with mucinex, albuterol nebulizer, zinc, vitamins c & d, and continued my usual daily doses of advair, singulair, plavix, and zyrtec. also performed deep breathing exercises. husband assisted with postural drainage and chest percussion.

march 18: doctor prescribed 3-day course of azithromycin for presumed bronchitis after a telemedicine appointment. lungs began to improve over the following week (no more rattling) but shortness of breath and aching around the lungs (probably muscle strain from labored breathing) continued.

march 23: took covid-19 nasal test at a drive-thru facility.

march 31: test results returned negative for sars-cov-2, presumably because it took so long for me to get a test that i was recovered by then. symptoms faded in the following weeks, with slight lingering cough.

april 26: developed a skin rash. thought it was allergies and took benadryl. noticed a slight tickle in right lung.

april 27: noticed right lung felt congested and was rattling again. cough remained unproductive. breathing not as labored as it was last month but worsening over two days. blood oxygen range between 89-99.

april 29: visited respiratory care clinic for physical examination. doctor did not hear any crackling in my lungs but ordered covid antibody test and chest x-ray.

may 1: antibody test returned negative for sars-cov-2 antibody igg and positive for sars-cov-2 antibody igm. doctor believes this means i have an active infection and should remain isolated. (i have been isolated since march 4.)

i have been unable to find a facility willing to perform a chest x-ray on a covid patient. i was turned away at the hospital my doctor recommended. the staff at the main entrance told my husband to take me to the er, er told him they do not perform chest x-rays there and that i should not be admitted, staff at main entrance became hostile when my husband reported this to them and they called security over before i flagged him back to the car where i was waiting. when i called ahead to another facility, they said they're not performing chest x-rays on anyone right now.

i am awaiting further instructions from my doctor, but in the meantime, i'm feeling pretty confused and hopeless. i don't understand why i'm having a flare-up after doing so well for so long. even now, i'll be doing alright for a few hours then suddenly worsen, back and forth. i'm having some weird muscle twitches and i can't tell if those are related or not. i don't know where to go for a chest x-ray without being admitted to the hospital (i'm in los angeles, by the way), especially since we're in the weekend now and nothing's open.

is any of this familiar to anyone? is it just going to keep getting worse?",$$$breath$$$thought$$$cough$$$self$$$breath$$$rash$$$cough$$$but$$$labored breathing$$$headaches$$$muscle$$$but$$$muscle$$$fatigue$$$neck$$$breathing$$$throw$$$breathing$$$away$$$awake$$$theyre$$$muscle strain$$$nasal$$$but$$$skin$$$fever$$$but$$$sitting$$$something$$$muscle$$$breathing$$$goes$$$but$$$wheezing$$$but$$$aching$$$cough$$$respiratory$$$clots$$$nausea$$$before$$$,$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Dyspnea$$$Rash$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Headache$$$Myalgia$$$Pyrexia$$$Myalgia$$$Fatigue$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Vomiting$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Myalgia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Chest tightness$$$Myalgia$$$Dyspnea$$$Palpitations$$$Pyrexia$$$Wheezing$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$other$$$Nausea$$$Ear infection/pain$$$,$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0012833$$$C0013404$$$C0015230$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0018681$$$C0231528$$$C0015967$$$C0231528$$$C0015672$$$C0741585$$$C0013404$$$C0042963$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0741585$$$C1260880$$$C0231528$$$C1260880$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C0235710$$$C0231528$$$C0013404$$$C0030252$$$C0015967$$$C0043144$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0000000$$$C0027497$$$C0013456$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

gcaa97,2020-05-02 13:28:00 UTC,"it feels endless. iâ€™m so so so tired of this fever. whenever it spikes, everything feels weird, like iâ€™m loopy and confused, and my whole body hurts, just waves of full body pain. itâ€™s starting to become a daily thing. my temp stays above 100 all day. i avoid tylenol as much as i can until the pain and disorientation becomes intolerable, because if i took it to reduce fever most of the day, my liver would probably end up damaged. wouldnâ€™t want that. i donâ€™t know how good it is to sit with a fever for so long, though.

i took a 10min walk the other night because i was desperate to feel some amount of normalcy, and the cool night air felt really really good, but i paid for it because the rest of the night and the entire next day, my whole body ached and my temp stuck around 101. wonâ€™t be doing that again for a while.

8 weeks of this. i hate it. i *hate* it. 8 weeks of *fever*. no breaks. no good days. no waves of symptoms where i feel ok for a day or two. iâ€™d be ok with the fever going away and just dealing with the fatigue and weakness. i think i could deal with that better. the fever sucks and it doesnâ€™t stop. iâ€™ve stopped feeling anxious about it a while ago. now iâ€™m just depressed, and thatâ€™s ok because this is depressing. my body isnâ€™t able to do what it used to 2 months ago, and iâ€™ve had a fever for so long, and iâ€™m stuck in quarantine because i have to be fever free for 72hrs before i can go to the store and feel like iâ€™m a person. itâ€™s depressing, so being depressed is an appropriate emotional state for this. 

iâ€™m trying to entertain myself the best i can, but thereâ€™s no substitute for human connection. iâ€™m not an extroverted person, not a social butterfly in the least, but iâ€™m not suited for prolonged isolation. i like being around select folk, like a partner or a friend, and giving/receiving hugs, or sitting close to someone on a couch, or hell, being in the same room as someone for longer than a few seconds. just *one* person is fine. seeing someone on a video call doesnâ€™t help in the slightest. i donâ€™t know what it is, but the actual physical presence of someone i want to be around is fulfilling enough, donâ€™t even have to be interacting the whole time or anything. i need a gd hug, if anything. one hug a day from someone else would be great, like hug for a few seconds once a day, and then whoever can go somewhere else and leave me to my quarantining. it sounds silly, but thinking about it is like...really wonderful. 

i donâ€™t want any advice. iâ€™m taking a daily vitamin. i go outside every day and sit for a bit on the porch. i expose myself to the sun when the sun is out. i drink a lot of water. iâ€™m not deficient on electrolytes. my bloodwork is fine. no pneumonia whatsoever. no bacterial infection. no bronchitis or sinusitis or whatever -itis. iâ€™ve been to the er. iâ€™ve been to the clinic. there isnâ€™t much else i can do. iâ€™m sad. thanks for listening to my sad rambling.",$$$but$$$state$$$fever$$$away$$$but$$$before$$$but$$$weakness$$$temp$$$but$$$depressing$$$tired$$$depressed$$$disorientation$$$depressing$$$whole$$$fever$$$sitting$$$anxious$$$breaks$$$whole$$$depressed$$$fever$$$fever$$$fever$$$pneumonia$$$temp$$$fatigue$$$but$$$fever$$$whole$$$fever$$$fever$$$,"$$$Pyrexia$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Fatigue$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Dyspnea$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$other$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$",$$$C0015967$$$C0012833$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0015672$$$C1832070$$$C0012833$$$C1832070$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C1832070$$$C0013404$$$C0741585$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0000000$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
gce0ay,2020-05-02 17:09:00 UTC,"i just found this group and it has been great to hear all of your experiences which sound similiar to mine. 

mine didnâ€™t entirely align with the top 3 the cdc listed and the media pushed. i have not had a fever, just elevated body temp that comes and goes. and no dry cough. the chest pressure has been insane, and it can surge and feel like an elephant is sitting on you. and the shortness of breath is bad. i limit how much i talk. i have the gi symptoms and someone wrote gurgling sounds, thatâ€™s exactly it with loose stools. also have the chills, night sweats, sinus headaches, ear aches, nasuea, weight loss, fatigue and muscle aches. when the chest pressure gets so high and diaphragm moving fast, i went to the ed. they screen out for heart attack and pneumonia, and say, with your family history of heart disease, get a stress test. i found this amusing as i cant even climb a flight of stairs without being seriously winded and i am in good shape. and no doc in the ed listened to my lungs.

so, we are these middle cases, where the ed says you are fine, your pcp says â€ride it outâ€œ and no one knows what else to tell you. you continue to stay at home isolated trying to figure it out hoping each day you will wake up better. your brain knows when you get better one day, from past illnesses, the next day you get progressively better, and this one is not that. its cruel, there is no visible path for progress.

at work, some days i sound fine on the conference calls (telecommuting), but they have no idea how sick i am. and everyone wonders, why i am not back in full-force cause you are supposed to be better after the 10-14 days per the cdc and what the media cover. and all your friends, while its been great to get their support, they donâ€™t understand what you are going through, and some expect daily updates. between working to keep the job to get paid, trying to heal, feeling sick and tired every day, and your life becomes overwhelming. you feel trapped, cause its the same every day.

when i get better, i am donating my plasma and will help science find a way to kick this disease to the curb. the suffering at every level is not something i would wish for my fellow man.",$$$but$$$elephant$$$overwhelming$$$chills$$$ear$$$tired$$$headaches$$$something$$$pneumonia$$$sinus$$$gi$$$fatigue$$$breath$$$night sweats$$$stress$$$nasuea$$$sweats$$$sitting$$$goes$$$cough$$$muscle$$$fever$$$temp$$$,"$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Chills$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Fatigue$$$Headache$$$Chest tightness$$$other$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Fatigue$$$Dyspnea$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Nausea$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Chest tightness$$$Palpitations$$$Cough$$$Myalgia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$",$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C1832070$$$C0085593$$$C0013456$$$C0015672$$$C0018681$$$C0235710$$$C0000000$$$C0948596$$$C0011991$$$C0015672$$$C0013404$$$C0020458$$$C1832070$$$C0027497$$$C0020458$$$C0235710$$$C0030252$$$C0010200$$$C0231528$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

gcsjvp,2020-05-03 11:34:00 UTC,"some good (?) news; i got bloodwork done to test for coronavirus antibodies a few days ago at citymd, and the test came back positive today! itâ€™s very scary to know that i had the virus at some point, especially because my mother, who had pneumonia as a child, exhibited very similar symptoms around the same time; but we are both functioning at 100% now. edit: i am 22, female, normal bmi, and exercise 3-4 times a week.

around the end of march, i started feeling very sick- almost like the flu, but with weirder symptoms that didnâ€™t quite fit the description of the flu. being the neurotic person that i am, i kept a very detailed google docs open to log my symptoms by the hour, and i wanted to share here so people can see another set of symptoms experienced. i shortened it for the sake of the post. i was tired and sick for about 2 weeks total, but the first week was when all the major symptoms showed.

day 1: began feeling a massive, throbbing headache, pressure in my head, mild body aches and chills. body temperature going up. hard to sleep; tossed and turned. 

day 2: woke up in the middle of the night with aches and chills. still have immense pressure in head with icepick migraines. slight cough, but no pressure in chest. could not sleep. progressively got worse throughout the day, even though there were moments i felt fine, like when i logged in for work and attended a dance livestream. developed a high fever towards the evening. felt nauseous and vomit-y. lots of chills and aches, with a little bit of a cough. took tylenol throughout the day. soaked through my shirt with sweat from fever. did not catch any sleep. super cranky at this point, wanted to fight coronavirus with my bare fists.

day 3: fever going down. less headaches. had severe diarrhea at this point; no food stayed down, and i felt like vomiting every time i sat down on the toilet. felt a little pressure on my chest when i lied down, but this might have been placebo. no appetite at all. cried a lot from feeling fatigued. told myself to get over it and stop being so emotional over a virus.

day 4: migraines are mostly gone. a lot less head tension and pressure than a few days ago. lost 6 lbs from lack of food and constant diarrhea. this is the point where i lost my sense of smell and taste completely. i will never take smell and taste for granted again.

day 5: developed really painful canker sores in my mouth that prevented me from eating further. no fever or headaches at this point, and diarrhea seems to have stopped as well. 

it took until day 10 to recover my sense of taste and smell, and for the sores in my mouth to go away. the whole time, i took a concoction of tylenol and antibiotics to help with the pain. i donâ€™t know if it helped, but it certainly did seem to relieve symptoms faster.  i lost a total of 8 lbs from this (although it bounced back just as quickly once i started being able to eat normally again). the presence of diarrhea made me think this was a stomach bug at first, but the loss of smell and taste definitely raised warning bells for me. 

anyway, iâ€™m glad that this was as bad as it got and i am looking into donating blood/plasma now that i know i have antibodies. hopefully some good news comes out about the prospect of cures from antibodies!",$$$fatigued$$$migraines$$$smell$$$migraines$$$but$$$but$$$cough$$$headaches$$$less head$$$smell$$$appetite$$$but$$$sleep$$$came$$$tired$$$taste$$$sleep$$$diarrhea$$$temperature$$$smell$$$diarrhea$$$whole$$$sense$$$chills$$$but$$$throbbing headache$$$but$$$sweat$$$chills$$$fever$$$away$$$catch$$$smell$$$pneumonia$$$eat$$$diarrhea$$$but$$$stomach$$$head$$$chills$$$painful$$$sense$$$stomach bug$$$sleep$$$but$$$fever$$$taste$$$headaches$$$taste$$$headache$$$fever$$$fever$$$diarrhea$$$nauseous$$$vomiting$$$cough$$$similar$$$head$$$head$$$cranky$$$taste$$$,$$$Fatigue$$$Migraine$$$Anosmia$$$Migraine$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Headache$$$Headache$$$Anosmia$$$Loss of appetite$$$Pyrexia$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Ageusia$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Anosmia$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Hyperhidrosis$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Palpitations$$$Anosmia$$$other$$$Loss of appetite$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Headache$$$Chills$$$Chest pain$$$Anosmia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Ageusia$$$Headache$$$Ageusia$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Nausea$$$Vomiting$$$Cough$$$Chest pain$$$Headache$$$Headache$$$Irritability$$$Ageusia$$$,$$$C0015672$$$C0149931$$$C0003126$$$C0149931$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0018681$$$C0018681$$$C0003126$$$C0232462$$$C0015967$$$C0917801$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C2364111$$$C0917801$$$C0011991$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0011991$$$C0741585$$$C0003126$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0020458$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0030252$$$C0003126$$$C0000000$$$C0232462$$$C0011991$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0018681$$$C0085593$$$C0008031$$$C0003126$$$C0011991$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C2364111$$$C0018681$$$C2364111$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0011991$$$C0027497$$$C0042963$$$C0010200$$$C0008031$$$C0018681$$$C0018681$$$C0022107$$$C2364111$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

gcyt8a,2020-05-03 17:39:00 UTC,"39m, no underlying conditions, sick only once in the last 13 years. have to summarize my experience. 

so this last tuesday i felt a tickle in my throat. it escalated continually, but without much of a fever at all, till thursday morning when i felt very dizzy, like right before fainting, but not fainting. shallow, fast breathing. collapsed in the hallway, threw up, sweating profusely, both hands tingled then went numb and tensed up like claws. feet went numb soon after, then legs and arms. couldnâ€™t move. no control. panic. i think i am dying and my 9yo is witnessing it. ambulance. emergency room. positive for covid19. good oxygen saturation. thinking about a will, and not even seeing my kids and wife again before i die slowly.

during my two nights there i never felt as bad again, sometimes completely healthy, most of the time one or two different symptoms. not much sleep past 20min here and there. sent home, with 4 weeks worth of anti coagulant shots, on third day since all blood tests after thursday had come back good/excellent.

first day home, good, a little cold sweat. slept great. second day (today), stomach upset in the morning, then good, but tired. around 9pm started feeling chest pain, both like a pressure and as something going on inside my lungs maybe. it escalates, maybe, might be me worrying. very hard to not focus completely on the pain and scaring the hell out of myself.

i know about the roller coaster ride of symptoms, i know it gets worse in the mornings and evenings, but i also know that no one actually knows anything, it could come back worse, it could go away. so itâ€™s like iâ€™m running through every scenario and the ones that feel feasible are the ones where the whole ordeal starts over from the beginning and ends with me dying.

wish there was a hotline to call, where i could talk to others who have gone through it all. that could calm me or just talk to me because i canâ€™t stop worrying or worse. reading post after post about people with severe symptoms after week 8 is not helping.

gd55om,2020-05-04 00:48:00 UTC,"hello.  

the antibody test(igg serology) i got at city md for free suggested that i have antibodies for sars-cov-2.  this is not necessarily a true positive nor can i assume i have immunity to reinfection for various reasons.

what were my symptoms?

headaches starting march 12
lost smell/taste march 20
nose and sinus inflamed but no mucus or drip whatsoever normally i get sinusistis often and there of buckets of postnatal drips. yeah itâ€™s nasty af. i was shocked that my nose was completely blocked but snotless and no clearing of the throat.
cough- slightly? i used my inhaler more than normal during this time.  
no fever - but the weekend of march 20 i was extremely sleepy.  not like â€œoh boy i am tiredâ€ like i could not not fall asleep and napped on and off. 

my roomates had no symptoms.  a close friend i hang with often had the same symptoms at the same time. 

i took allergra and sudafed daily bc i believed i had allergies.  i stopped taking these on march 28 when i smelled garlic finally.  i stopped taking these and i was fine.. just the normal pollen induced itchiness. i havenâ€™t used my inhaler since april 5th or so...

bio nerds: 
i am also on xolair which blocks ige, this is regarded by some professionals as â€œimmunosuppressiveâ€ however some say it would help with covid19 bc it can block interluekin 3/4 that can produces cytokines. 

i believe i got this disease when i rubbed my eyes on the subway on march 10.  but who knows. 12 years old cough in my face all year long. 

tl;dr:  city md said i probably had corona-lite

as i had the most mild case, i recovered within 14 days when i got my senses back. i never experienced a cough but my mom did. she was way more fatigue. got the family pulse oximeter, forehead thermometer, zinc, etc. my dad watches a lot of foreign news stations and believes since he isnâ€™t showing symptoms heâ€™s okay, but iâ€™m gonna still try to get him a test anyway. masks and gloves do not prevent everything, i wish they understood that more. my mom tested positive a week ago but had some symptoms before. 

most likely sheâ€™s around day 12 in that range. has diabetes and her worse days were mainly the 7-9 range for now. no constant cough, just very fatigue. i hope it says a mild case, she says sheâ€™s feeling better but the news say diabetes people are largely at risk. i have noticed my dad cough more than usual while doing his daily activities, but he said he coughed like this before the virus even came around. i think heâ€™s a little in denial but i hope to get him tested soon.

i went to get the antibody test last wednesday evening and received my results yesterday as igg positive. i was quite relieved to know that i had already had such a mild case. i believe that citymd uses the abbott labs test which has been shown to be very accurate in identifying false positives. for context iâ€™m a mid 20s male in good shape, work out regularly with a bmi of 24 and no underlying conditions.

gdmyu7,2020-05-04 19:47:00 UTC,"didnâ€™t have classic covid symptoms, but i did lose my senses for about a week. the first day of my symptoms i had some fatigue and nasal congestion, and that went away after day 1. i tested positive around 4/16 and got my senses back day 14 or so of the virus. itâ€™s a been a little over a week since iâ€™ve â€œfully recoveredâ€ but that for me just meant getting my senses back. the past 2 days, the same sort of nasal congestion came back for a few hours. 

i drank hot water the past nights to help me clear it up before bed, and felt myself getting very dehydrated during night time. i couldnâ€™t sleep because i had so much cotton mouth. no matter how much i drank it would be the same, but when i wake up i donâ€™t experience the dehydration sense and feel absolutely normal again. because i think i had a mild case before, i try to observe every little symptom with me now because it could be due to covid. 

if this is a second wave for me, does this mean iâ€™m contagious again? itâ€™s probably been close to a full month since i contracted it. i didnâ€™t get tested until almost a week into my symptoms. asking because iâ€™m a hope to my mom, i felt that if i got better quick she (tested positive last week) will be the same. sheâ€™s around day 12 and says she feels normal again, no fatigue etc. iâ€™m scared if iâ€™m gonna be getting a second wave, then we need to anticipate hers as well. i was really happy today when she said she felt fine.",$$$away$$$scared$$$fatigue$$$dehydrated$$$nasal$$$fatigue$$$but$$$before$$$nasal$$$dehydration$$$sleep$$$sense$$$came$$$but$$$before$$$but$$$,"$$$Fatigue$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Fatigue$$$Dehydration$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Dehydration$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Anosmia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$",$$$C0015672$$$C1832070$$$C0015672$$$C0011175$$$C1260880$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C1260880$$$C0011175$$$C0917801$$$C0003126$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

thank you to everyone that showed so much love and support! it felt great. so far i have not relapsed in any of my coronavirus symptoms, and feel great in that aspect. 

however, i now have experienced anaphylaxis-like reactions twice since 5/2 that put me in the er. it definitely seems to be food related (i already have an easy to manage dairy allergy). my throat now gets tight and swollen, hives, hard to breathe, the whole thing. i have a short list of what i think it is and other items iâ€™m suspicious about. iâ€™m seeing an allergist tomorrow. 

the thing that makes it so strange is the timing. as soon as i get over corona, i now have this life threatening allergic reaction that doesnâ€™t seem to be going away; out of left field. iâ€™m just really curious to see if anyone else has heard of this type of thing in association with covid. with how finicky this virus is, and how little is known in the grand scheme of things, i doubt i can get an answer but thought itâ€™d be worth checking out. 

thanks!

ge4odv,2020-05-05 15:48:00 UTC,"37m no real prior conditions. i hesitate to say mild symptoms, but i still have lingering chest pain, on and off coughing, tired and some other little things. iâ€™ve had most of the symptoms in waves and went through one rough relapse at week 4. iâ€™m a little better since then, but it seems like each day is the same... not really better, but not really worse. and each day it seems like itâ€™s something a little different that is bothering me. iâ€™ve had every emotion during this as well. 

this forum has really helped and iâ€™ve read some people that are much worse and feel for them.

i keep going back and forth with trying to get blood work, more tests done to make sure iâ€™m ok. i didnâ€™t really have a primary doctor before this. i linked up with a doctor by phone but do not know him well. 

his advise is to stay home and not to risk going to hospital/clinic/doctors office. says the risk of reinfection/getting something else is not worth the reward cause there are still so many unknowns with virus. and since iâ€™m not really getting worse just to hang in there. i wasnâ€™t even sure i could get to a doctor for blood work (not for covid testing, but to make sure heart/liver/kidneys/lungs are ok.) had two chest x-rays way back on day 1 and 10, and an ekg at day 10 that was clear.

today i was able to schedule an appointment at a clinic for a physical/bloodwork in a few days. but after talking to him and seeing other people on day 60+ iâ€™m nervous as hell to go.

ge4uh8,2020-05-05 15:57:00 UTC,"i know this can come in ebbs and flows and am prepared for this to come back but as of this week i feel really great. my mom and i both feel as though our symptoms were minor. my dad definitely got it worse than us but has been stable. figured iâ€™d share our experience so far! 

apologies for the length, wanted to be thorough. 

me - 26f, no medical history.
days prior to 4/17 i had some chills and a sore throat. i also had some pretty bad heartburn which iâ€™ve never had before this. throughout the whole thing iâ€™ve had no real fever, o2 97-99%. 

4/17  sore throat got worse, very dry and felt like it was cracked open, had a mild cough. 

4/18 had a low grade fever (99.5) with chest congestion. 

4/19 fever gone, chest congestion was better. 

4/20 chest congestion and cough came back. fatigued. 

4/21 chest congestion slightly worse.  i lost my sense of smell & taste. head and sinuses throbbing. burning sensation in one nostril that persisted for a few days. 

4/22 smell/taste still gone, chest felt heavy/achy/congested. got tested this day, was (+)

4/23-4/27 headaches got more severe and i had a slight increase in shortness of breath, very fatigued these days as well. appetite decreased & very nauseated. 

4/28 headache/sinus ache to end all headaches, i was incapacitated all day. 

4/29 -5/1 breathing easier, aches subsided only mild headaches. one episode of gi upset. 

5/2-5/3 energy is back, the weird ache in my chest as almost gone. appetite is back. still get little episodes of shortness of breath. i was able to do a short yoga class without any issues. heartburn is back. 

5/4-5/5 - feel 100% better. just want out of this house! awaiting results of retest. 

mom - 59f, history of a narrow trachea which causes a chronic cough. takes a steroid inhaler. her o2 has been 96-98%, no fever besides her first day of symptoms. 

4/22 low grade fever, 100.4 and chills. coughing more. 

4/23 started to feel missternal chest congestion, little short of breath. 

4/24-4/30 tested 4/24, came back (+). up and downs every day with the chest congestion and shortness of breath, but never winded. cough slightly worse.  she had the same chest aches/heaviness i had. biggest complaints were nerve pain in her legs and hands, persistent dizziness, as well as some diarrhea and appetite loss. honestly seems like she was had more neuro symptoms than anything. 

5/1-5/3 energy is back, chest heaviness/aches are gone. her appetite is improving but the diarrhea has stayed. has jolts of nerve pain but mostly has gone away. 

5/4-5/5 little short of breath here and there but otherwise no symptoms. 

dad - 64m
history of high bp, heart failure, copd, 35 year smoker - quit 12 years ago. the doctor told us his baseline o2 is between 94-96% and heâ€™s been between 94-98% throughout this. 

4/21-4/25 dry cough and pretty intense muscle aches. overall feeling pretty well though. tested 4/25, came back negative but the doctors believe we tested him too early and heâ€™s presumptive positive. 

4/26-4/27 overnight between these two days he developed a 102 degree fever, rigors, severe headache. his hr was 100-110 with the fever (came down once it was gone). says itâ€™s the worst heâ€™s ever felt in his life. we werenâ€™t able to get the fever down until midmorning on the 27th. very, very fatigued. fever did come back but not as high. 100.8 was the highest we got. had a lot of diarrhea 4/27. 

4/28-5/1 fatigue was persisting but he was able to get up and do stuff around the house. his cough had gotten worse, but he denied any shortness of breath or chest pain. he just had that same weird chest heaviness that me and my mom had.  no fever at all (usually around 98.6). we had him go to the doctors cuz of the persistent cough and his chest x-ray came back clear. very achy throughout body. 

5/2-5/3 still coughing but it is lessening. chest congestion has cleared. still fatigued but not as much. muscle aches and nerve pain is gone. says heâ€™s feeling a lot better. retested, waiting for results. 

5/4 spiked a fever again, 100.4. o2 dipped slightly. cough is nasty this day. fatigued. 

5/5 - no fever, cough slightly improved. very fatigued. 

besides my dads temps and one day of low o2, we have all had stable vitals. i can honestly say that my mom and i are feeling close to 100%. dad is on the mend but he is a few days behind us. 

not funny but kind of funny, my brother and sister in law (she is an lpn at a nursing home that has a lot of covid cases) actually caught covid as well a few days before us, and we havenâ€™t seen each other since february. their three kids, including a 3 month old, were all asymptomatic. they are now recovered after two weeks of illness!",$$$fever$$$energy$$$fever$$$headaches$$$but$$$grade fever$$$cough$$$sense$$$fatigued$$$but$$$breath$$$headaches$$$fever$$$fever$$$cough$$$fever$$$fatigue$$$diarrhea$$$came$$$persistent cough$$$breath$$$cough$$$came$$$fatigued$$$appetite$$$but$$$burning$$$but$$$degree fever$$$appetite$$$gi$$$but$$$breathing$$$came$$$persistent cough$$$but$$$fever$$$smell$$$heaviness$$$cough$$$low grade fever$$$before$$$but$$$fatigued$$$breath$$$appetite$$$but$$$appetite$$$came$$$fever$$$headache$$$grade fever$$$but$$$fatigued$$$achy$$$muscle$$$diarrhea$$$sinuses$$$fever$$$hr$$$breath$$$but$$$low grade fever$$$chills$$$legs$$$achy$$$came$$$heartburn$$$taste$$$throat$$$headache$$$cough$$$but$$$away$$$cough$$$fatigued$$$throat$$$diarrhea$$$taste$$$but$$$head$$$fever$$$cough$$$fever$$$but$$$sinus$$$cough$$$whole$$$cough$$$heaviness$$$heartburn$$$coughing$$$breath$$$energy$$$dizziness$$$smell$$$before$$$coughing$$$breath$$$fatigued$$$heaviness$$$but$$$headaches$$$fever$$$chills$$$fever$$$muscle$$$,$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Anosmia$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Loss of appetite$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Loss of appetite$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Cough$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Chest tightness$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Dyspnea$$$Loss of appetite$$$Pyrexia$$$Loss of appetite$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Myalgia$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Cough$$$Chest pain$$$Ageusia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Headache$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$Fatigue$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Ageusia$$$Pyrexia$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Paranasal sinus discomfort$$$Cough$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Cough$$$Chest tightness$$$Chest pain$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Anosmia$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Fatigue$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Headache$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Pyrexia$$$Myalgia$$$,$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0003126$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0011991$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C0232462$$$C0015967$$$C0008031$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0232462$$$C0011991$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0010200$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0235710$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0013456$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0013404$$$C0232462$$$C0015967$$$C0232462$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0741585$$$C0231528$$$C0011991$$$C0948596$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C0741585$$$C0741585$$$C0010200$$$C0008031$$$C2364111$$$C2363731$$$C0018681$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$C0015672$$$C2363731$$$C0011991$$$C2364111$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0948596$$$C0010200$$$C0741585$$$C0010200$$$C0235710$$$C0008031$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0012833$$$C0003126$$$C0013456$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0015672$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C0015967$$$C0231528$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

ge66ll,2020-05-05 17:06:00 UTC,"i'm 32, living in nyc, and have been symptomatic since 3/30 (so on day 37).

symptoms (shortness of breath, low grade fever and chills, chest pain / burning / tightness, fatigue, loss of smell and taste) were at their most severe between days 1 and 15, however i have continued to cycle through shortness of breath, occasional low grade fever, rib / chest / abdominal pains.

in the past two weeks i've had two covid tests, an ekg monitor and chest x-ray. negative on all of the tests, and vitals looked good.

has anyone else continued to have symptoms, even after getting multiple negative tests? if so, what has your medical assessment been? my doctor thinks that symptoms mean infection - but after 37 days and two negative tests, i kinda doubt i'm still shedding the virus. but looking for any info that might help me understand why symptoms continue to persist. some kind of post viral syndrome maybe?",$$$fever$$$burning$$$tightness$$$low grade fever$$$chills$$$taste$$$fatigue$$$but$$$fever$$$grade fever$$$grade fever$$$abdominal$$$breath$$$low grade fever$$$but$$$breath$$$smell$$$,$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Chills$$$Ageusia$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Abdominal pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Anosmia$$$,$$$C0015967$$$C0008031$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0085593$$$C2364111$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0000737$$$C0013404$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0003126$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
geapmz,2020-05-05 21:31:00 UTC,"my dad is a doctor who works in the er or emergency department but ever since the pandemic he's been shifted to a different ward made solely for patients suffering from covid-19.

he came home sick once with a mild cough, luckily he got a 10 day holiday and recovered from it, but during that time


i started to suffer from the following symptoms aswell:

'shortness of breath, light headedness, runny nose, flu, chest pain, coldness, chills' 

i also lost my sense of smell and taste somewhere down the line. i can't taste anything and even if i spray my shirt with as much deodorant as i possibly can, i still can't smell it. i know this symptom is present in the common cold as well but i've never personally experienced it and i've had the cold many times.

even though the symptoms for my cold subsided, my loss of smell and taste are still imminent. it's been a little more than a week since i lost them, and 2 weeks since the breathlessness began

i live in qatar, and the corona virus cases are at there peak here so i don't wish to go to the hospital to get tested since my symptoms aren't too severe. if i do go now, if i don't have the virus i'll surely have it when i come back. it's not worth the risk

i also felt a slight fever, and felt weak, but it went away in a day.

another thing to note is that when i got the flu, my mother and both my brothers got the flu on the same day but there colds ended in a day with some medicine.

my mom, and i, have lost our sense of smell and taste though.

so it got me thinking.

do i have the virus? what do y'all think? any input would be greatly appreciated in these trying times. i wish you all the best of health.",$$$smell$$$smell$$$but$$$taste$$$runny nose$$$smell$$$smell$$$sense$$$but$$$but$$$away$$$taste$$$nose$$$but$$$breath$$$sense$$$weak$$$light headedness$$$cough$$$breathlessness$$$chills$$$taste$$$taste$$$weeks since$$$came$$$but$$$fever$$$,$$$Anosmia$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Ageusia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Anosmia$$$Anosmia$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Ageusia$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Anosmia$$$Fatigue$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Cough$$$Dyspnea$$$Chills$$$Ageusia$$$Ageusia$$$Myalgia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$,$$$C0003126$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C2364111$$$C1260880$$$C0003126$$$C0003126$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C2364111$$$C1260880$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0003126$$$C0015672$$$C0012833$$$C0010200$$$C0013404$$$C0085593$$$C2364111$$$C2364111$$$C0231528$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

day 1 - woke up with a stuffy, clogged nose and a massive headache.

day 2 - sinuses still clogged, slight chest pain, harder to breath when using my stairs. decided to go to the doctor. fever of 101, was tested. slight body ache.

day 3 - productive cough, coughing up mucus, having to constantly clear my throat. body aches getting worse, pressure in chest, fever wavering between 100-101. sinus status: screwed

day 4 - same as day 3, more tired, very tired by this point.

day 5 - coughing is harder because it makes me run out of breath, feel like there's a brick in my chest, but still not the worst i've ever had. would think bad cold if i didn't know. sinuses still clogged, fever broke. body is aching so much putting a blanket on hurts.

day 6 - test results came back positive. fever still broken, have to nap several times a day at this point. sinuses starting to clear, cough becoming ""more productive"" (easier to cough up the crap in my throat). headache but not pounding like before.

day 7 - so. tired. can't walk to the bathroom without needing to nap. zero appetite (haven't been hungry since around day 4), sinuses are mostly clear. still clearing my throat every 5 minutes, brick in chest is gone, breathing seems a bit easier. no fever.

day 8 (today) - woke up at 3pm and still tired. can't get up to go to the bathroom without resting at least twice because i'm just that tired. breathing is okay, only stairs really make me run out of breath at this point. no chest pressure. coughing is the most productive it's been, easier to get things up and spit it out. sinuses still a little stuffed up, but not too bad. fever still gone. very achy still.

things i've done: tons of water and hot broth. hot bath helps the body aches (only after my fever was gone, before that it was a room temperature bath). tylenol every few hours. otc decongestant for my sinuses (didn't do anything first few days, helped a lot when it got a little better). i sleep when my body tells me to, i don't fight it, even if that means napping an hour after i've woke up.  i try to get up and stretch a bit, walk around the room, it seems to help my cough loosen.

gf1it6,2020-05-07 02:47:00 UTC,"hi all,

i tested positive 3/22. my symptoms were mild lasting a week. phlegm in throat, lowgrade fever, some minor chest pain. i was out of work for a month and had no symptoms for almost a month. i go back to work 4/23 since i am considered medically recovered based on cdc guidelines. i did not have another test. i notice some people at work are coughing but i'm hoping that since i had covid already i have antibodies that make me immune. i feel completely fine and healthy.

one week later, i wake up with fatigue, high fever, gi issues, heart palpitations and chest pain. i take the day off from work and hope i'll recover over the weekend. over the weekend, i get an email saying one of my close proximity coworkers who was coughing when i came back to work tested positive with covid-19. this time my symptoms are worse. the heart palpitations are what really bothers me. my heart is beating so hard, i can feel my lips twitching. any activity even getting up from bed aggravates my heart rate. any food i eat, i can feel my blood pressure dropping, heart rate flaring and have sudden exhaustion.

now i have no idea if this a reinfection or relapse. but my symptoms are suddenly a lot more severe than the first time i got sick. it feels like a completely different infection.

i am wondering if instead of becoming immune, the initial infection made me vulnerable to reinfection.

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/antibody-dependent\_enhancement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/antibody-dependent_enhancement)

doctors in wuhan were silenced when they tried to ring the bell on reinfection.

this article shows patients recovering but getting reinfected and dying from heart issues which i am afraid is what i am experiencing. if anyone has any similar experiences please let me know.

i would like to find out why after a month of being completely fine, as soon as i go back to work and exposed to a confirmed positive, i become symptomatic again.

&#x200b;

update (5/7/20 1:35 pm) :

i visited my pcp today. i had an ecg. normal. lungs listened to with a stethoscope. normal. temperature is 98.8. fever is down from the initial miserable fever of 100+ i felt during the weekend, but 98.8 is still higher than what i normally am around which is 97.6. i still have chest pain. elevated heart rate was noted. the doctor suggested that we could do another covid-19 test but the result wouldn't change my treatment plan as far as she could provide and there was no treatment for covid. the doctor did not refer me to a lung or heart ct due to my vitals appearing normal. i was referred to a cardiologist for my palpitations. bloodtest was conducted to check for infection. i am waiting on those results.

my main take away from this experience is that we have no idea the long term implications of this virus. we don't know how long we can remain contagious for and whether or not we might relapse or possibly be reinfected after seemingly fully recovering for 1 month like i did.

all, please remain vigilant and careful even though you have recovered!",$$$heart rate$$$similar$$$heart rate$$$temperature$$$phlegm$$$palpitations$$$gi$$$but$$$throat$$$but$$$palpitations$$$but$$$fever$$$but$$$palpitations$$$heart rate$$$eat$$$heart palpitations$$$fever$$$came$$$fever$$$fatigue$$$fever$$$heart palpitations$$$coughing$$$but$$$away$$$exhaustion$$$coughing$$$,$$$Palpitations$$$Chest pain$$$Palpitations$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Palpitations$$$Diarrhea/GI issues$$$Pyrexia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Palpitations$$$Loss of appetite$$$Palpitations$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Fatigue$$$Cough$$$,$$$C0030252$$$C0008031$$$C0030252$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0030252$$$C0011991$$$C0015967$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0030252$$$C0232462$$$C0030252$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0015672$$$C0010200$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

so, the first supplement that helped me with severe nausea was activated charcoal. i felt severely nauseous when i had a fever, i couldn't eat. i read that it's because i was intoxicated with the virus and charcoal supplement can help with intoxication. it really helped me!!! usually charcoal is used when you eat something bad, have nausea and need to clean your gut. 
another supplement that helped me was valocordin. i bought it in russian online pharmacy. it's a tincture that supports heart. it's natural, it's a blend of adonis herb,  lily of the valley leaf, hawthorn berry, valerian root, peppermint oil. it helped me with rapid heart rate and anxiety. 
i also took some vitamins (d, c) and zinc. and was drinking tea with manuka honey. not sure if it helped me or not. i'm not a doctor but i just wanted to share this with everybody. 
do you take any medications/supplements that helped you with the symptoms? please share!

gg0w83,2020-05-08 16:25:15 UTC,"i live in a household with three others, and despite them bringing all make and manner of people into the house and ignoring pretty much *every* precaution, i wound up with covid and all three of those idiots tested negative. go figure. most cautious/safe one of the bunch and the healthiest one, and i wind up being the one that gets it. unsurprisingly, they are no help and actually pretty damn rude.  


i'm going to tell you right now that if i wasn't as active as i usually am, i would be hospitalized or worse. this thing mentally and physically beats you up something fierce. it cut my breathing capacity by half and suddenly minor tasks became exhausting. i've been keeping a record of things since day 3, when i went in to get checked out at a hospital. lucky for me, no damage to my lungs or heart or anything like that..though i thought it odd that they checked for heart issues. (*this is before people were winding up with clotting and strokes*.)  


**my symptoms include the following**: bloodshot eyes, dry/chapped lips, dehydration, headaches/migraines, shortness of breath, exhaustion over minor tasks, nausea, dizziness, confusion, sudden changes in how i feel temperature (one moment cold, the next overheated.) i get a very weird, metallic aftertaste that is disgusting before some of the symptoms seem to hit. muscle pain...i ache all over, and it progressed from minor aches to major aches. some days are better than others. insomnia is also common due to the above interfering with sleep, but that has gotten a little better as i keep myself propped up to keep any airways from getting congested.  


***unusually enough, i have not registered a fever since this began.*** my temperature has ranged from 96.4 to the highest being 98.7 deg.  i feel overheated at times, and i have to drink water constantly as i seem to dehydrate much faster than usual. (i would wager it about 20-30% more than usual. i try to stay hydrated as it is.)  i was supposed to be quarantined until may 4th, or 3 days after any fever. they ***did not t***ell me that its advised to remain quarantined until 7 days after you stop showing symptoms.  
(i have still maintained quarantine anyway as i don't want to chance giving this nasty thing to anyone. i take this very, very seriously. i might get lucky and make it through this but it doesn't mean someone else will be that lucky. i won't have that on my conscience.)  


i have no idea how long this thing can potentially last..but it's certainly something else. i've been seriously ill before and this is nothing like anything i've ever been hit with. for those that don't have it...take proper precautions, and take this seriously. you don't want to get hit with it, and you don't want to see someone go through it, either. to everyone that does have it, good luck, and i hope your situation improves.  


i have found that this thing does not seem to like vitamin a, c, d and b12. i've heard zinc as well, but i have no means to test that. i just noted that keeping a moderate dose in my diet seems to make things a little more bearable and i seem to feel a bit better off and on.

gg30lo,2020-05-08 18:19:20 UTC,"just thought i'd share my symptoms since my experience wasn't nearly as bad as a lot of others who've posted on here. 

april 10th, started getting a sporatic dry cough. didn't think much of it and felt mostly ok otherwise other than maybe a little tired. 

april 11th, woke up with a fever, bad aches and fatigue. that lasted through april 13th.

april 14th, aches started to go away but i developed a really awful headache. still had a low grade fever

april 17th headache subsided but i developed bad eye pain. i started to lose sense of taste and smell around here too. still had a low grade fever. i got tested on this day at a drive through testing center doing saliva tests.

april 19th, eye pain subsided but woke up with a rash on my legs and arms. around here my lungs started to feel ""irritated"". it wasn't difficult to breath, but i could tell my lungs were inflamed. still had low grade fever. result came back positive from test on 17th. 

april 21st, my lungs were the worst this day. still had no difficulty breathing but they were very inflamed and it would make me cough if i took a deep breath. rash also spread to my torso and a little on my face. still had a low grade fever. 

april 22nd, my body must have gotten a hold of itself and i woke almost all better. lungs were very minimally irritated and rash was almost all gone. first day with a temp below 99. 

april 23rd, lungs still didn't feel 100% but i was otherwise feeling healthy. fever did not come back after this and lungs slowly got better over the course of a few days. 


overall the experience was miserable, but manageable, like any cold i've had, just longer. i work from home and there was only one day i wasn't able to work at all. i only took tylenol for pain and fever reduction, and only needed to take it through the first half of the illness. 

i have two roommates, one never got symptoms, the other got a phlegmy cough and some fatigue for a few days. the roommate with the cough tested positive for it after i did. we weren't really isolating from each other since we live in a small apartment and didn't really have a choice. 

i also got an antibody test done on may 4th because i want to donate plasma, which came back negative. though i've since been reading about how unreliable the current antibody tests are. i may try to get retested in another week to see if i can donate plasma. 

ask whatever questions you'd like. i hope my symptoms can show people who are worried that it's not always as bad as some of the other posts on here.

edit: dates are not exact other than start and finish.

edit2: sense of smell and taste came back a day to two after the 23rd.

gghowb,2020-05-09 11:48:05 UTC,"husband and i were both sick for about a week, my main symptoms were loss of taste and smell and lethargy.  his main symptoms were a light, nagging cough, and a mild fever.  father-in-law was sick for about 2 weeks with no appetite, lethargy, mild-moderate fever, and confusion.  we were never tested for covid, but fil's doctor diagnosed him as presumed positive.   we have no residual symptoms and i am back to my full workout schedule (stopped for 2 weeks).  

i detailed my day-to-day symptoms, and summarized by husband and fil's symptoms here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/covid19positive/comments/g1bcwk/all\_different\_mild\_symptoms\_in\_same\_household/](https://www.reddit.com/r/covid19positive/comments/g1bcwk/all_different_mild_symptoms_in_same_household/)

frankly, i would have been in work monday and friday of that week (white collar desk job).  i may have taken off tuesday, wednesday, thursday, but its tough to tell if the lethargy/feeling off was exacerbated by the quarantine blues/being on my period.  if it was a normal week, i probably would have gone to work - that's how mild the symptoms were.

also - husband and i have been taking vitamin d, vitamin c, and probiotics.  the vitamin d was because i was afraid of not getting sun while in quarantine,  vitamin c was a panic buy, and probiotics are because i'm generally a fan, have yogurt every day, and was worried i wouldn't be eating it as much.   with the new info coming out on vitamin d deficiency showing up in cases, i'm very grateful that we had been taking it for a month before we got sick. 

this week, husband and i waited for 2 hours to get an antibody test blood draw at citymd.   they use the abbot test, with serology by quest.    we both tested positive for antibodies - i understand that there are some questions regarding test accuracy, but i feel better that both of us had the same result.  we didn't take my fil as waiting in line for 2 hours isn't in the cards for him.

ghw4yp,2020-05-11 16:47:26 UTC,"hi everyone! 

just wanted to give a final update on my situation. i have my original post with my first update down below. basically, i started having allergic reactions six weeks after coronavirus. 

i went to the allergist today and tested negative for all allergens, food and otherwise. even dairy, which i was diagnosed with two and a half years ago by another allergist who did not do a skin prick test for food. 

i am ecstatic. i was really expecting the worst. the doctor said that a perform storm occurred in my body: the effects from the coronavirus, stress, and awful acid reflux. the hives were my bodies overreaction to everything going on. i have reflux that is irritating my throat so much that the inflammation feels like my throat swelling shut. the food caused the reflux to be too much and the hives compounded the reaction. my body was weakened by the coronavirus, allowing all of this to take place. all of the general problems iâ€™ve been having are due to reflux and am on meds. i could get a stomach ulcer if iâ€™m not careful. 

the best part in all of this is that he told me that itâ€™s safe for me to be around people again. 

i wish i could explain it the way the doctor did. it made much more sense than how iâ€™m putting it. thank you everyone for the support. iâ€™m glad to finally get all of this behind me. 

update: finally recovering - now having allergic reactions (likely?) unrelated to covid 19

link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/covid19positive/comments/ga1vth/finally_recovering/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

thank you to everyone that showed so much love and support! it felt great. so far i have not relapsed in any of my coronavirus symptoms, and feel great in that aspect. 

however, i now have experienced anaphylaxis-like reactions twice since 5/2 that put me in the er. it definitely seems to be food related (i already have an easy to manage dairy allergy). my throat now gets tight and swollen, hives, hard to breathe, the whole thing. i have a short list of what i think it is and other items iâ€™m suspicious about. iâ€™m seeing an allergist tomorrow. 

the thing that makes it so strange is the timing. as soon as i get over corona, i now have this life threatening allergic reaction that doesnâ€™t seem to be going away; out of left field. iâ€™m just really curious to see if anyone else has heard of this type of thing in association with covid. with how finicky this virus is, and how little is known in the grand scheme of things, i doubt i can get an answer but thought itâ€™d be worth checking out. 

thanks!

3rd testing: neg nasal swap for co-vid 19 and finally just enough antibodies to test pos for co-vid 19.

i really doubted i'd see this day. i've been ""stay at home"" since nov, exceptions only to doctors and specialists, including my oncologist. due to low immunity caused by cancer, i never thought i'd get well and definitely never have enough antibodies against co-vid 19 and the many other viruses and illnesses to get a positive test result for co-vid 19.

because of these reasons, i've been symptomatic since november. my journey has been much longer than most. my symptoms have been tough on my body and the ""stay at home"" quarantine was even more tough on my sanity! i struggled often and was questioned frequently by family, friends, and some op here on this reddit quorum.

i have proof for any other doubters and i have finally been symptom free for 4 days (still have occasional headaches - but hey everyone have them sometimes) i call them ""relief reminder headaches"" i still have not left my  my home except for dr testing!

i want to thank all those who have prayed for me, those who have offered positive uplift and support, and god's grace and healing.

gigups,2020-05-12 14:14:14 UTC,"to start off with i am covid positive. started having symptoms the 18th of april and started isolation that day, and got tested the 28th . i have been feeling worse since this past saturday. i went into the er yesterday night at scripps mercy in chula vista on h st. my chest pain and upper back pain is getting worse to the point where my neck is stiff and it hurts when i try to move my neck. i canâ€™t even comb my hair. i try not to go to the doctors for anything unless i think itâ€™s absolutely necessary. people that know me know that iâ€™m good with pain management and i donâ€™t complain about anything thatâ€™s minor. but i am worried because of being covid positive and since iâ€™ve had bronchitis last week i was worried that it may have turned into pneumonia. the stabbing pain in my back is horrible. tylenol does not help. i went in the er parking where they are registering patients. the male nurse that took my vitals asked me what was wrong and i told him what i was feeling. asked me in a scale of 1-10 how much pain i felt. i told him  i was really hurting, that i couldnâ€™t even lie down on my back because of the pain so to me it was a 10. this nurse then asked me if my pain was worse â€œthat when jesus died in the crossâ€... i just looked at him, thinking of what i heard was right. he asked me again the same question. i told him how can you compare that to my situation ? am i not allowed to feel pain ? of course iâ€™m not dying and bleeding out ! but my pain is not letting me sleep and i canâ€™t stand it anymore. i have had twitching-jerking in my body for days now. i am scared this might be something else. this is a new illness that no one knows what new symptoms are. they make me feel like i shouldnâ€™t complain about my pain, like hey stop complaining and go home your not dying. they donâ€™t know how i feel. they canâ€™t feel the stiffness, pressure, tightness i have in my chest and back. the massive headache i have and the numbness and pain in my neck. you are really going to compare my pain to what jesus felt on the stake? this is why i wait to go to the doctor or hospital unless itâ€™s absolutely necessary. when i canâ€™t handle the pain anymore is when i have decided to go. never going to scripps again. this broke my heart and feelings toward nurses in this time i need them the most. by the way, the female nurses inside the er hospital where so nice. this complaint is towards that specific male nurse that made me feel like shit, made me feel like a liar and exaggerating my pain. i know what pain is like. i have had twins with no anesthesia. i suffered 3 years of gallbladder pain and that was way worse than giving birth. totally disappointed in how he minimized my pain and how i should feel. i was not going to complain about it but i canâ€™t stop thinking about it and needed to take this off my chest. i am feeling so humiliated. i usually let things go but this just hit my heart. this covid illness is new. how do you know what the pain level is ?? i canâ€™t fucken breath right !!! i canâ€™t lift my arms or do my bed without taking a rest every minute to breath grab air and stop coughing!!! nurses inside where so nice, did an ekg, heart ultrasound, told me i was ok and send me home with stronger painkillers and muscle spasms medicine which has helped. i finally took a good nights rest. woke up at 430 am and pain is back so the pills are exactly lasting 8 hours. need no sympathy from anyone but please do not tell me that my pain isnâ€™t as bad as jesus when they brutally nailed him on the stake. thatâ€™s a horrible comparison. shame on you especially if your religious and mentioning his name for that type of question. next thing you know he will be asking me if it hurts when i breathe as much as the jews when they were brutally gassed to death. no offense meant. unbelievable.",$$$but$$$headache$$$coughing$$$worried$$$breath$$$neck$$$but$$$stabbing$$$something$$$lift$$$pneumonia$$$but$$$muscle$$$breath$$$sleep$$$but$$$muscle spasms$$$massive headache$$$worried$$$muscle spasms$$$neck$$$but$$$arms$$$neck$$$tightness$$$stand$$$scared$$$breathe$$$,"$$$Pyrexia$$$Headache$$$Cough$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Dyspnea$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Fatigue$$$other$$$Pyrexia$$$Myalgia$$$Dyspnea$$$Insomnia/sleep disturbance$$$Pyrexia$$$Myalgia$$$Headache$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Myalgia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Dyspnea$$$",$$$C0015967$$$C0018681$$$C0010200$$$C1832070$$$C0013404$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0008031$$$C0235710$$$C0015672$$$C0000000$$$C0015967$$$C0231528$$$C0013404$$$C0917801$$$C0015967$$$C0231528$$$C0018681$$$C1832070$$$C0231528$$$C0741585$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0741585$$$C0235710$$$C0012833$$$C1832070$$$C0013404$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

i went to my pcp today to get checked out. i had a curve ball thrown at me last week though. wednesday of last week, i found a tick attached to my back. i didnâ€™t think much of it after i pulled it off and went about my life. the bite has since developed a red circle around it and i woke up sunday with horrible muscle soreness in my upper back muscles with neck stiffness. i had a temp of 99.9 and my wbc was elevated. so, labs to test for lyme and colorado tick fever were ordered.

but wait! thereâ€™s more! i told my dr about the returning symptoms and how iâ€™ve started to notice i have pressure in my chest. my blood pressure was 117/85 and my oxygen saturation was at 98 but when she listened to my lungs, she could hear my struggle for deep breathing so she put the finger thing back on and my pulse stayed steady between 102/103. she ordered chest x-rays for tomorrow to see if i have some lung damage from the virus. 

i also have an appointment with a neurologist tomorrow to see if i need imaging for the speech issues.

gj2zrw,2020-05-13 13:02:22 UTC,"i know there are many long term covid19 sufferers in here. i just wanted to hear your perspective on this.

how do you feel that your symptoms have been treated? do you feel that you've gotten all the care you need?

it's poor timing right now for me because i'm just frustrated at this point in time. i just spent another day trying a new hotline to get advice or help.

i've tested positive with a pcr test and have positive antibodies for covid19. i've been in the hospital once my heart started hurting (a week after my lung pressure was as it's worst). they've noticed kidney damage from my bloodwork. the doctors did a thorough check-up but i also never felt like i was taken that seriously. i'm a low risk person as i'm young and was very healthy.

since then i've seen a variety of different doctors (cardiologist, urologist, and gp's). the message always seems to be overwhelming positive. ""well you tackled it as you now have antibodies"" or ""just rest inside and it'll get better.""

i don't even bother calling my family doctor anymore because her advice is just the same - ""just rest""

i'm so fed up of resting and waiting. i'm 67 days in and still feel miles away from close to normal, let alone feeling close to healthy. i want someone to study my experience, i want someone to try and help me beside giving me the same message of just rest. i've been resting for 66 out of 67 days and the improvement has been marginal. i almost wish i was severe enough for icu care just so i could get better. it's crazy that many people were on death's door and are out living normal lives and yet i can't walk outside for more than 30 minutes without experiencing deteriorating symptoms again.

sorry, i just needed to vent to the community here. i do appreciate the support that many of you have given me as it really does still give me a glimmer of hope.",$$$overwhelming$$$away$$$frustrated$$$but$$$kidney$$$alone$$$,"$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Fatigue$$$Irritability$$$Pyrexia$$$Abdominal pain$$$Fatigue$$$",$$$C1832070$$$C0015672$$$C0022107$$$C0015967$$$C0000737$$$C0015672$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

/end of tl;dr

&#x200b;

i thought i would share my story to help alleviate some of the anxiety on this sub regarding long-duration covid-19 illness. i am a health care professional at a local medical center in the northeast us. my demographics: male, 34 years old, caucasian (southeast europe), bmi 18.5, good overall health. i'm that guy who very rarely gets sick. i can't remember the last time i had a fever or anything like the flu before this.

i first showed symptoms on march 10 (tingling in my windpipe). i started to quarantine right away. my symptoms progressed into a heaviness/fullness feeling in my chest in the course of a few days. by day 6 i started to have a temperature of 99.5 to 99.8 pretty steady until about day 15, when it returned to normal. during this time i completely lost my sense of smell. my symptoms during this time continued to include the heaviness/fullness feeling in my chest with occasional feeling of irritation (hard to explain the feeling, kind of like a mild burning in the chest, maybe an inflammatory response). no cough, but i did feel like i had to clear my throat... but it was never productive (no mucus). lying down in the prone position seemed to help with the heaviness.  at this point i lost my sense of smell.

at that time, testing was very hard to come by. my doctor would not test me because my symptoms were not severe enough. and my employer did not have enough tests available to test me at that time. this was still way back when our country was caught completely unprepared for this pandemic.

between day 15 and day 36 i had fluctuations in mild chest irritation/fullness/heaviness. my temperature also fluctuated from normal to about 99.5 or so. some days i would feel almost normal. my sense of smell slowly came back to normal. during this time i had a chest x-ray done (day 31) which came back clear.

i was finally able to be tested through my employer on day 36. the results were positive for covid-19. this was a bummer, but not really a surprise to me as what i was experiencing was unlike anything i've ever had and was primarily respiratory in nature. i worried about why this illness was lingering for so long.

between day 36 and day 50 i continued to have fluctuating chest sensations including irritation/burning, and a new aching feeling deep within my lungs. i tested positive again on day 50. this worried my doctor, who on day 52, ordered a ct scan with contrast to check my lungs for clots and/or embolism. this came back clear.

the mild ache in my lungs subsided and finally on day 63 and 64 i tested negative. all testing was done by nasal swab.

i have no idea where i got the virus from. it's scary to think how contagious this disease is... i was always very careful with hand hygiene and not touching my face and things like that, and i was not in contact with anyone showing any symptoms whatsoever. this was, of course, before the lockdowns. i think itâ€™s clear this virus was running rampant in the us way before our leadership was taking it seriously.

i wish i could say iâ€™m completely recovered after two full months. iâ€™m still feeling a fluctuating mild irritation/burning feeling in my chest. this feels like an inflammatory response to whatever damage the virus did to the lining of my lungs or chest cavity (not my specialty - take my conjecture with a grain of salt). it has been getting less noticeable and less frequent, though. hopefully this goes away for good, but boy does it linger.",$$$fever$$$embolism$$$before$$$burning$$$smell$$$smell$$$but$$$thought$$$goes$$$worried$$$fever$$$came$$$but$$$aching$$$came$$$burning$$$away$$$but$$$worried$$$burning$$$nasal$$$heaviness$$$clots$$$mucus$$$came$$$heaviness$$$grade fever$$$away$$$sense$$$cough$$$heaviness$$$sense$$$breath$$$heaviness$$$anxiety$$$temperature$$$low grade fever$$$smell$$$throat$$$but$$$temperature$$$sense$$$cough$$$smell$$$reading$$$burning$$$respiratory$$$before$$$burning$$$heaviness$$$before$$$,"$$$Pyrexia$$$Dyspnea$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Chest pain$$$Anosmia$$$Anosmia$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Palpitations$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Cough$$$Pyrexia$$$Body ache & Pain$$$Cough$$$Chest pain$$$Fatigue$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Chest pain$$$Rhinorrhea$$$Chest tightness$$$other$$$other$$$Cough$$$Chest tightness$$$Pyrexia$$$Fatigue$$$Anosmia$$$Cough$$$Chest tightness$$$Anosmia$$$Dyspnea$$$Chest tightness$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Oropharyngeal pain$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Anosmia$$$Cough$$$Anosmia$$$Dyspnea$$$Chest pain$$$Dyspnea$$$Ear infection/pain$$$Chest pain$$$Chest tightness$$$Ear infection/pain$$$",$$$C0015967$$$C0013404$$$C0013456$$$C0008031$$$C0003126$$$C0003126$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0030252$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0010200$$$C0015967$$$C0741585$$$C0010200$$$C0008031$$$C0015672$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$C0008031$$$C1260880$$$C0235710$$$C0000000$$$C0000000$$$C0010200$$$C0235710$$$C0015967$$$C0015672$$$C0003126$$$C0010200$$$C0235710$$$C0003126$$$C0013404$$$C0235710$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C2363731$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0003126$$$C0010200$$$C0003126$$$C0013404$$$C0008031$$$C0013404$$$C0013456$$$C0008031$$$C0235710$$$C0013456$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$

i have been taking omega 3, vitamin d, , multivitamins, magnesium, theanine (for calm), and tylenol to help with deep breathing exercises. 

my husband was given zithromax at the beginning and i canâ€™t help but wonder if thatâ€™s why heâ€™s doing much better than me with no chest pain.

i need to hear something comforting about recoveries. anything that would help me feel like things wonâ€™t be getting worse from here. iâ€™m desperate. in a constant state of fear of the virus taking over completely. at what point is the general peak and timeline for the beginning of recovery? 

i have complete loss of smell and taste for 5 days now. i heard of a correlation both with a mild progression but also more severe- information is all over the place which doesnâ€™t help. please, anything to help would be deeply appreciated.",$$$but$$$temp$$$something$$$breathing$$$ox$$$state$$$taste$$$smell$$$breath$$$breathing$$$something$$$panic$$$but$$$pneumonia$$$panic attacks$$$temp$$$panic attacks$$$,"$$$Pyrexia$$$Pyrexia$$$Chest tightness$$$Dyspnea$$$other$$$Dizziness/disorientation/confusion$$$Ageusia$$$Anosmia$$$Dyspnea$$$Dyspnea$$$Chest tightness$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$other$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$Pyrexia$$$Anxiety, stress & general mental health symptoms$$$",$$$C0015967$$$C0015967$$$C0235710$$$C0013404$$$C0000000$$$C0012833$$$C2364111$$$C0003126$$$C0013404$$$C0013404$$$C0235710$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C0000000$$$C1832070$$$C0015967$$$C1832070$$$,$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$0$$$
gjkmeh,2020-05-14 07:33:29 UTC,"hi,

i am 24 and i have asthma that is controlled with daily inhaled corticosteroids. i tested positive for covid, and i am now symptomless for the past few days. i just wanted to post my own experience with the virus which has thankfully been mild. interestingly enough, i did not have a high fever or a cough at any time.

&#x200b;

day 1 - 

first sign of symptoms. woke up with a bad headache, muscle aches, cold/hot flashes (but no fever), sore throat, irriated throat, mild shortness of breath, sleeplessness and waking up drenched in sweat 

&#x200b;

day 2 - 

throat more irritated, hurts to swallow, woke up with headache and pain behind eyes, muscle aches had reduced, and no hot/cold flashes, chest a bit tight with mild shortness of breath. 

&#x200b;

day 3 - 

symptoms improving, headache with pain behind eyes, small amount of blood in clear white mucus, bloody boogers, no hot flashes, reduced muscle aches, chest a bit tight but breathing fine, hard to sleep at night 

&#x200b;

day 4 - 

breathing and chest fine. throat fine. able to sleep properly. bit of headache 

&#x200b;

day 5 - 

mild shortness of breath, sensation of clogged mucus that can't be coughed out, mild sinus pressure and a bit of chest tightness 

&#x200b;

day 6 - 

covid positive result confirmed. developing lack of taste and smell, with a very weird smell that is still present. feeling fine, and slept well. 

&#x200b;

day 7 - 

breathing fine, but chest a bit tight.

&#x200b;

tiny streaks of blood in white mucus, some soreness in chest, but generally no symptoms

&#x200b;
